# sysreview

## This is...

Mostly an unsystematic archive of things related to systematic reviews or meta-analyses.  
  
1. I have started programming a [flexdashboard for creating relational databases](/relational_database). However, due to the lack of incentive or necessity, this project is paused indefinitely. If the incentive/necessity changes I will continue working on it.
2. I compared [ASReview](https://asreview.nl/) with [Rayyan Systematic Review](https://rayyan.ai/). Check out the [slides of the comparison here](/asreview_vs_rayyan).
