# sysreview

## This is...

Mostly an unsystematic archive of things related to systematic reviews or meta-analyses.  
  
1. I have started programming a [flexdashboard for creating relational databases](/relational_database). However, due to the lack of incentive or necessity, this project is paused indefinitely. If the incentive/necessity changes I will continue working on it.
2. I compared [ASReview](https://asreview.nl/) with [Rayyan Systematic Review](https://rayyan.ai/). Check out the [slides of the comparison here](/asreview_vs_rayyan).
3. I created a [script to scrape google scholar](/scrape_google_scholar) results and save them as csv compatible with Rayaan and ASReview. You can use any search term and define the number of results exported.
