Abstract = {The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for English language arts (ELA)
   called for several ``key shifts{''} in classroom instructional practice.
   This study combined archived video data on classroom teaching collected
   in 2010 with new video data on classroom teaching collected in 2018 to
   conduct a pre-/postexamination of the extent to which this corpus of
   lessons showed the kinds of key shifts in ELA instruction called for by
   the CCSS. The data presented in the article show meaningful time trends
   consistent with some, but not all, of the key shifts in ELA instruction
   called for by the CCSS. These findings are discussed in light of the
   goals of the study and prior research on post-CCSS instruction in
   classrooms across the country.},

Abstract = {Methods to transcribe and represent classroom video data are central to
   studying teaching and learning in classrooms. However, current methods
   focus on encoding and representing data over time, not space. In this
   paper, we demonstrate the value of a new methodological approach called
   interaction geography to transcribe and interactively visualize
   classroom video data over space and time. We use interaction geography
   to illustrate classroom participation patterns in two case studies from
   teacher education research that, until now, have been challenging to
   see. Findings characterize strengths, limitations, and next steps to
   expand interaction geography in classroom research and suggest new
   questions to consider when encoding and representing classroom research
   data over space and time.},

Title = {Studying the quality of inquiry-based teaching in science classrooms. A
   systematic video study of inquiry-based science teaching in primary and
   lower-secondary schools},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 17},
Abstract = {A large body of research has studied the role and potential of inquiry
   to increase the quality of teaching in science education. While much of
   this existing research is based on international large-scale assessment
   studies, we still lack a clear understanding of the factors that
   influence the quality of inquiry-based science teaching in actual
   classroom practices. In this paper, we operationalise teaching quality
   through an observation manual, and we drew on this manual to
   systematically analyse video data of instructional practices in 20
   Norwegian science classrooms at the primary and lower-secondary school
   level (73 observed lessons and about 450 students). We identified
   varying quality in the individual inquiry phases and differences between
   primary and lower-secondary schools. We observed that primary-school
   students collected and documented data more systematically than
   lower-secondary students and that consolidations were slightly more
   emphasised and of higher quality at the lower-secondary than at the
   primary level. Moreover, our findings indicate that inquiry-based
   teaching gave students more freedom to make their own choices and
   increased the quality of student participation in the classroom. Based
   on our findings, we discuss how teachers can improve the quality of
   inquiry-based instruction and empower students in the classroom.},

Abstract = {The reliance on teaching assistants (TAs) for inclusion is discussed in
   relation to the quality of instructional support. Swiss policy
   stipulates two distinct models for TAs working in mainstream classes:
   they can either be employed to work with a particular pupil with special
   educational needs (SEN) or be employed as a general aide to provide
   support for the whole class. This article describes a study
   investigating teachers' and TAs' interactions with pupils during
   individual seatwork based on observational video data and examining how
   these reflect the roles foreseen for TAs. The analysis is based on
   videos of 90 minutes in each of the 31 primary school classes with TA
   and teacher being present. Results of the video analysis of individual
   seatwork demonstrate that TAs interact longer with pupils with SEN and
   pupils with lower attainment levels than teachers do. The analysis of
   the content of instructional support reveals that TAs often use
   transmissive approaches, i.e. telling a pupil how to tackle a task or
   even provide the correct answer, whereas co-constructive support, such
   as scaffolding, is less prevalent. The findings are discussed regarding
   their relevance for policy and the development of practice.},

Pages = {52-64},
Abstract = {The possibilities inherent in the collection and use of video footage
   point to an important innovation for classroom research. Unfortunately,
   researchers often experience uncertainty about incorporating video into
   their methodological approach as it can present a potential minefield of
   operational, technical, and ethical issues that require consideration
   and negotiation. Nevertheless, with the increased emphasis on the use of
   digital technologies, the timing is right to engage in more in-depth
   discussions about the role of video data in education research. In
   contributing to this discussion, this article unpacks several issues
   connected to the use of video technology as a tool for data collection
   and analysis. This article focuses on addressing some of the barriers
   faced by education researchers such as making sampling decisions,
   maintaining research authenticity, and grappling with ethical issues
   that arise. In terms of the advantages for researchers, this article
   highlights the suitability of video technology for classroom-based
   research because it provides a permanent and detailed record, which can
   be analyzed from multiple perspectives. These issues are explained
   through the experiences of an education researcher, who used video as
   the main data source for documenting and examining the practices of two
   effective primary science teachers in Perth, Western Australia.},

Abstract = {The teacher echo refers to teachers? almost verbatim repetition of
   student responses and can be used to provide implicit feedback about
   students? achievement or understanding. Echoing student answers is a
   controversial strategy of classroom discourse, as some critics see it as
   a bad habit and consequently deny its use in the classroom. The aim of
   this research project was to learn more about the perceptions of
   unprejudiced, prospective teachers on this controversial type of teacher
   feedback. Therefore, two short videos of a simulated lesson with and
   without teacher echo were created. A sample of 410 teacher trainees was
   asked to rate the perceived instructional quality and answer a knowledge
   test about the lesson contents. Results showed no significant
   differences in perceived cognitive activation and teacher dominance, but
   higher perceived constructive support and better knowledge acquisition
   when using the teacher echo. Thus, its application seems to be more
   beneficial than harmful.},

   have examined the role of metadiscourse and how it assists teachers and
   students to manage classroom communication of scientific knowledge.
   Thus, the purpose of this study is to analyze how science teachers use
   metadiscourse to construct scientific knowledge with their students.
   Based on a corpus of classroom video data, I developed a typology of
   metadiscourse commonly found in science classroom discourse. The
   typology comprises six major categories of metadiscourse, namely text
   connective, knowledge connective, activity connective, attitude marker,
   epistemology marker, and interpretive marker. In addition, I showed how
   the analysis on metadiscourse was necessary to complement the gaps from
   classroom analysis focusing on the interaction and content development
   aspects of classroom talk, particularly during the opening and reviewing
   stages of constructing a scientific explanation. With a better
   understanding of metadiscourse, its potential use as a pedagogical
   intervention to promote science learning is then discussed.},

Abstract = {Capturing and measuring instructional patterns by using standardized
   observation manuals has become increasingly popular in classroom
   research. While researchers argue that a common vocabulary of teaching
   is necessary for the field of classroom research to move forward,
   instructional features vary across classrooms and contexts, which poses
   serious measuring challenges. In this article, we argue that potential
   biases embedded in observation systems have to be identified and
   addressed in order for interpretations of results across different
   classrooms and contexts to be valid and relevant. We identify three
   aspects of possible systematic biases (related to the grain size of
   conceptualization, operationalization, and sequencing of lessons) and
   how these may influence ratings of instructional quality when an
   established observation system (the Protocol for Language Arts Teaching
   Observations {[}PLATO]) is applied in the contexts of Nordic mathematics
   classrooms. We discuss implications of such possible biases and make
   suggestions for how they may be addressed.},

   physics classrooms in Singapore, a recurring pattern in the relationship
   was observed as the teaching sequence of a lesson unfolded. It was found
   that as the mode of representation shifted from enactive (action based)
   to iconic (image based) to symbolic (language based), there was a
   concurrent and coordinated shift in the classroom communicative approach
   from interactive-dialogic to interactive-authoritative to
   non-interactive-authoritative. Specifically, the shift from enactive to
   iconic to symbolic representations occurred mainly within the
   interactive-dialogic approach while the shift towards the
   interactive-authoritative and non-interactive-authoritative approaches
   occurred when symbolic modes of representation were used. This
   concurrent and coordinated shift has implications on how we conceive the

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The recognition of students' learning behavior is an important method to
   grasp the changes of students' psychological characteristics, correct
   students' good learning behavior, and improve students' learning
   efficiency. Therefore, an automatic recognition method of students'
   behavior in English classroom based on deep learning model is proposed.
   The deep learning model is mainly applied to the processing of English
   classroom video data. The research results show that the video data
   processing model proposed in this paper has no significant difference
   between the data obtained from the recognition of students' positive and
   negative behaviors and the real statistical data, but the recognition
   efficiency has been significantly improved. In addition, in order to
   verify the recognition effect of the deep learning model in the real
   English classroom environment, the statistical results of 100
   recognition result maps are compared with the results of manual marking,
   and the average recognition accuracy of 100 recognition effect maps is
   finally obtained, which is 87.33\%. It can be concluded that the
   learning behavior recognition model proposed in this paper has a high
   accuracy and meets the needs of daily teaching. It further verifies that
   the developed behavior recognition model can be used to detect students'
   behavior in English class, which is very helpful to analyze students'
   psychological state and improve learning efficiency.},

Abstract = {Action is a highly theorised aspect of social life. Nonetheless, it
   remains a relatively neglected source of data within educational
   research. This article attempts to highlight the significance of the
   analysis of organised action within educational research. It describes
   and demonstrates an analytical approach to action applicable to the
   classroom developed from approaches to the analysis of bodily
   communication and action in drama education and from new approaches to
   rhetoric. These approaches draw on social semiotic theories of making
   meaning in order to describe the complex relationship between the
   semiotics of social action and the situated experience of learning in
   the classroom. This article describes how action realises meanings and
   shapes classroom interaction through the application of the schema to
   video data from a science lesson on energy with Year 9 pupils (14 years
   old). Finally, it draws attention to the research and pedagogical
   implications of a focus on action in the science classroom and in
   education more generally.},

Abstract = {The paper presents findings of the IRSE Video Study Physics, a research

   Physics instruction was analysed in the conceptual framework of
   opportunities to learn. The sample consisted of 62 lessons of physics
   taught at various lower-secondary schools in Brno, the Czech Republic.
   The lessons were video-recorded, transcribed and coded, and the data
   were analysed with regard to the aspects under investigation. The paper
   presents findings on: a) organisation of classroom activities; b)
   sequencing of the teaching process; c) using didactic tools and media;
   d) using experiments. The results show that lower-secondary physics
   instruction is teacher-oriented to a great extent, which is indicated by
   the organisation of classroom activities. Modern media (ICT, audio and
   video recordings) were scarcely employed: the teachers' primary didactic
   tool was the blackboard. The teachers did not employ experiments very
   often when an experiment occurred, it tended to be the teacher to carry
   it out.},

Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 9},
Abstract = {Studies examining students' learning behavior predominantly employed
   rich video data as their main source of information due to the limited
   knowledge of computer vision and deep learning algorithms. However, one
   of the challenges faced during such observation is the strenuous task of
   coding large amounts of video data through repeated viewings. In this
   research, we confirm the possibilities of classifying students' learning
   behavior using data obtained from multimodal distribution. We employed
   computer algorithms to classify students' learning behavior in animated
   programming classrooms and used information from this classification to
   predict learning outcomes. Specifically, our study indicates the
   presence of three clusters of students in the domain of ``stay
   active{''}, ``stay passive{''}, and ``to-passive{''}. We also found a
   relationship between these profiles and learning outcomes. We discussed
   our findings in accordance with the engagement and instructional quality
   models and believed that our statistical approach will support the
   ongoing refinement of the models in the context of behavioral profiling
   and classroom interaction. We recommend that further studies should
   identify different epistemological frames in diverse classroom settings
   to provide sufficient explanations of students' learning processes.},

Abstract = {How do students learn to explain? We take this exemplary research
   question for presenting two antagonist traditions in German mathematics
   education research and their synthesis in an ongoing video study. These
   two traditions are (1) the German Didaktik approach that can be
   characterized by its epistemologically sensitive analyses and
   specifications of mathematical contents, and (2) the interactionist
   approach. By presenting the theoretical framework and some empirical
   insights, the article shows that learning to explain can be
   conceptualized as increasingly participating in navigating practices
   through different epistemic fields.},

Title = {Dialogic teaching and students' discursive identity negotiation in the
   learning of science},
Journal = {LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {48},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {23-31},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study sought to understand how dialogic teaching, as enacted in
   everyday classroom interaction, affords students opportunities for
   identity negotiation as learners of science. By drawing on sociocultural
   and sociolinguistic accounts, the study examined how students'
   discursive identities were managed and recognized in the moment and over
   time during dialogic teaching and what consequences these negotiations
   had for their engagement in science learning. The study used video data
   of classroom interactions collected from an elementary science learning
   project and placed a specific analytic focus on four students in
   particular. The results reveal evidence of a rich variety of discursive
   identities exposed during dialogic teaching, thus demonstrating how the
   students' identity negotiations were configured according to the social
   architecture of classroom discourse. Addressing the temporal dimension
   of dialogic teaching points out critical shifts in the students'
   discursive identities, of which identification is argued to be pivotal
   when creating equitable science learning opportunities. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Background Although professional development (PD) programs often use
   video, extraneous information during video viewing can distract
   teachers. We developed a discourse visualization tool, the Classroom
   Discourse Analyzer (CDA), to support teachers' reflections on classroom
   discourse in video-based PD workshops. Methods We used a randomized
   controlled trial with an embedded case study to examine the efficacy of
   a year-long video-based PD program using the CDA. Findings The 24
   intervention teachers significantly increased their use of productive
   talk moves in mathematics classrooms relative to the 22 comparison
   teachers (Cohen'sd = 0.67 to 2.35,p<.05). Moreover, a linear mixed model
   analysis showed that 882 students of the intervention teachers had
   significantly higher mathematics achievement scores than the 625
   comparison students (Cohen'sd= 0.24,p<.05). The case study showed that
   CDA's multiple representations of classroom discourse and interactive,
   process-oriented visualizations facilitated the teachers' navigation of
   classroom video data. Additionally, video and visualizations prompted
   the teachers to reflect on the data with their peers for evidence-based
   reasoning and discussion. Contribution This study demonstrates the
   efficacy of a video-based PD program for increasing classroom discourse
   and student learning. It also informs the design of visualizations to
   enrich video-based PD.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses teachers' corporeality and its influence on the
   structuring of mathematics classroom interaction. The present
   contribution explores the way a teacher's bodily activity is implicated
   in the (re)production of social inequality, and challenges the
   assumption that the teaching and learning of mathematics is primarily a
   linguistic and semiotic accomplishment. I argue that the teacher's body
   is an active force in the formation of mathematically `able' and `less
   able' students. Drawing on the work of Bernstein (Pedagogy, symbolic
   control, and identity: Theory, research, critique (Revised Edition),
   Rowman \& Littlefield, Lanham, 2000) and his sociological theory of
   pedagogy, and expanding his tools to address corporeal factors, I show
   how students are positioned as high-performing within structures of
   classroom interaction. Video data from classroom interaction is used to
   track differences in how teachers reveal and conceal structural
   peculiarities of school mathematics. Comparing the interaction of
   different teachers illustrates the role that corporeality plays in
   establishing distinctive orientations to meaning-making in the
   mathematics classroom.},

Journal = {TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {110},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Feedback is a prevalent teaching practice in mathematics classrooms, but
   few studies have documented how mathematics teachers enact feedback in
   classrooms. We investigated how 47 teachers provided feedback in 172
   mathematics lessons in Norwegian lower secondary schools. We analyzed
   the quality of feedback, the quantity of feedback, and whether the
   feedback addressed students' procedural skills, conceptual
   understanding, or engagement in mathematical practices. Teachers spent
   large amounts of time providing concrete and specific feedback, most of
   it addressing procedural skills while conceptual feedback was less
   common. The study highlights details of feedback relevant for both
   pre-and inservice mathematics teacher training. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Abstract = {Teaching effectiveness is a core issue in educational research; however,
   there is little consensus about the most important results of classroom
   teaching from an international perspective. The effectiveness of
   teaching has remained a `black box' for a long time. In the secondary
   study described in this paper we used empirical data for Shanghai taken
   from the international Organization for Economic Co-operation and
   Development (OECD) study Global Teaching InSights (GTI)-initially the
   Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) Video Study-which was
   based on videotaped direct observations of classroom teaching.
   Eighty-five junior high school mathematics teachers and their students
   in Shanghai were observed to explore the impact of specific teaching
   practices on students' interest, self-efficacy, and mathematics
   achievement scores. The results revealed that social-emotional support
   and instruction quality were the key dimensions relating to the
   characteristics and differences of mathematics lessons in Shanghai.
   While the former had a significantly positive impact on students'
   general mathematics self-efficacy, the latter had a significantly
   positive impact on students' mathematics interest. Although specific
   teaching practices had no significant direct impact on students'
   mathematics achievement scores, social-emotional support and instruction
   quality considerably influenced students' academic performance in an
   indirect way via general self-efficacy.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to examine the complex relationships
   between educational policy and classroom practice. By employing a
   sociocultural perspective, we examine formulations inscribed in
   socio-material artifacts about what students should learn and how they
   should engage with knowledge. We explore how these formulations are
   mobilized in instructional work and the implications this activity has
   for student participation. To address this issue, we analyzed video data
   of how teachers invoke competence aims from the national curriculum in
   their instructional work in six classrooms. The analytical procedures
   were derived from interaction analysis. The analysis focuses on how such
   formulations explicitly mediate social interaction as it unfolds on a
   micro level. The findings show that competence aims gain different
   functions as they are mobilized in classroom practice; in other words,
   they serve different purposes in teachers' instructional work and
   anticipate different modes of student participation. In this study, the
   competence aims were (a) invoked as a source of authority, (b)
   translated into instructions, and (c) mobilized to obtain social order
   in the classroom. More rarely, the competence aims were used in
   meta-level discussions, where they functioned to reach agreements on how
   to pursue work toward joint goals. We discuss the implications of these
   ways of invoking competence aims for student participation.},

Title = {Practices of self-selection in the graduate classroom: Extension,
   redirection, and disjunction},
Journal = {LINGUISTICS AND EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {46},
Pages = {70-81},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study investigates the practices of student self-selection in the
   graduate-level American classroom. Self-selection is a crucial part of
   the learning process because it allows for the exchange of students' and
   teachers' views, analyses, and opinions, making these exchanges into a
   whole-classroom experience. Active students who make oral contributions
   in class are believed to learn more than those who do not (Weaver \& Qi,
   2005) and to enhance their critical thinking (Crone, 1997; Garside,
   1996). In the graduate classroom, however, student self-selection may be
   challenging, as the material students tackle tends to be highly
   technical. Given the importance of student self-selection in this
   academically demanding context, more analytical attention must be
   devoted to uncovering the nature of participation. With 20 h of video
   data collected from graduate classes and analyzed through the lens of
   conversation analysis (CA), this study identifies three main practices
   employed by self-selecting speakers: extension by piling, contribution
   with hand-raising, and participation prefacing. Each occurs with
   different degrees of `fittedness' to prior talk, in part evidenced in
   the different levels of mitigation use by the self-selectors. The
   findings of this study contribute to the small body of classroom
   discourse studies in the graduate classroom and provide a first step
   towards understanding how self-selections may be strategically managed
   or promoted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The role that specific emotions, such as pride and triumph, play during
   instruction in science education is an underresearched field of study.
   Emotions are recognized as central to learning yet little is known about
   the way in which they are produced in naturalistic settings, how
   emotions relate to classroom learning during interactions, and what
   antecedent factors are associated with emotional experiences during
   instruction. Data sources for the study include emotion diaries, student
   written artifacts, video recordings of class interactions, and
   interviews. Emotions produced in the moment during classroom
   interactions are analyzed from video data and audio data through a novel
   theoretical framework related to the sociology of human emotions. These
   direct observations are compared with students' recollected emotional
   experiences reported through emotion diaries and interviews. The study
   establishes links between pride and triumph within classroom
   interactions and instructional tasks during learning episodes in a
   naturalistic setting. We discuss particular classroom activities that
   are associated with justified feelings of pride and triumph. More
   specifically, classroom events associated with these emotions were
   related to understanding science concepts, social interactions, and
   achieving success on challenging tasks.},

Title = {How a Flexible Classroom Affords Active Learning in Electrical
   Engineering},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {62},
Number = {2},
Pages = {91-98},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Contribution: This paper presents evidence demonstrating ways in which
   flexible classrooms (which have movable tables and chairs that can be
   rearranged into different layouts) afford active learning. It highlights
   the quantitative increase in active learning that occurs for one
   instructor and discusses how the affordances of the flexible classroom
   support qualitatively better instructor-student and student-peer
   interaction during active learning.
   Background: Research has shown that students benefit from active
   learning, but instructors still perceive many barriers to implementing
   it. Flexible classrooms may reduce some of these barriers, and their
   affordances may promote better student engagement and allow instructors
   to use more active learning than traditional lecture-style classrooms
   do.
   Research Questions: What are the differences in the amount of active
   learning used by an instructor between flexible classrooms and
   traditional classrooms? How do instructors and students use the
   affordances of flexible classrooms during active learning?
   Methodology: An instructor at a large Midwestern university taught the
   course Introduction to Electronics Circuits in a traditional classroom
   one semester and in a flexible classroom the next. The two research
   questions were addressed through complementary quantitative and
   qualitative analyses of video data, classroom observations, and
   instructor interviews to detail the amount of active learning and the
   way the instructor facilitated it in the flexible classroom.
   Findings: The time the instructor devoted to active learning increased
   in the flexible classroom, while the time she devoted to instructor-led
   examples decreased. The affordances of the flexible classroom also
   encouraged more frequent and better student-instructor and student-peer
   interaction.},

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Two-way bilingual immersion education, offered in a fast-growing number
   of primary schools in the United States, provides primary language
   maintenance to minority language speakers while Simultaneously offering
   an enrichment ``foreign{''} language immersion experience to
   English-speaking children in the same classroom, generally with the same
   teacher. This fusion of two different groups of children, two different
   sets of expectations, is controversial: Is it possible to accomplish
   both goals at once, or will teacher and program inevitably end up
   serving the needs of dominant English-speaking children first? The
   equation is further complicated when the English speakers in a program
   come from mainly highly educated middle-class families, and the Spanish
   speakers come from mainly working-class immigrant families, as is the
   case in many of these programs. Drawing on audio and video data from a
   yearlong Study in a second-grade two-way classroom that shares this
   class gap between language groups, and using a methodology that fuses
   ethnography and discourse analysis, this article explores the ways
   English-speaking children can impact classroom conversational dynamics.},

Title = {Fifty ways to work with students' diverse abilities? A video study on
   inclusive teaching practices in secondary mathematics classrooms},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INCLUSIVE EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 MAY 12},
Abstract = {Inclusive teaching practices can be characterized as recurrent ways how
   teachers work with their students' diverse abilities, but how exactly
   are they enacted in subject matter classrooms? The paper proposes a
   conceptual framework to unpack inclusive practices according to the
   student ability to which they refer, in five typical jobs for teachers:
   (a) identifying the demands for the ability, (b) differentiating
   learning goals, (c) compensating for low abilities, (d) enhancing
   abilities, and (e) addressing the abilities in joint learning. The
   proposed job-ability framework for inclusive teaching practices is
   substantiated in a video study of 25 mathematics lessons on percentages
   with the same curriculum material. In total, rather than 50, 133
   different inclusive teaching practices were identified in 3862 sequences
   and structured into 20 cells. They address four abilities (from most
   often to least often): (1) selective attention/working memory, (2)
   mathematical pre-knowledge, (3) language proficiency, and (4)
   metacognitive regulation. The large variance of enacted practices
   identified within and between lessons calls for professional development
   that elicits, leverages, and extends the repertoire of practices. While
   the reported frequencies are specific to the chosen teaching unit, the
   job-ability framework can be transferred to other subject-matter
   classrooms and used in professional development programs.},

Abstract = {Utilizing video study methodology where participants, as well as the

   nature of students talking aloud during peer collaborations in

   talking aloud: (1) clarification of thinking (i.e. spontaneous
   utterances related to the mathematical task); (2) expressions of
   confusion (i.e. ``I don't understand!{''}), with the explicit intent of
   eliciting support from peers; or (3) a combination of (1) and (2). The
   findings also show that students do not perceive other students' talking
   aloud as an inter-communicative gesture. This research highlights the
   importance emphasizing to students that talking aloud during peer
   collaborations should be viewed as a potential antecedent to
   communicative interaction and the importance of teaching students how to

   how this constructs social actions. The results show how participants
   co-construct the gutter as meaningful space, hereby organizing time,
   actions, and events in narratives. The paper evinces that gutters are
   co-constructed as too narrow or too broad, relating chronologically and
   logically to surrounding panels. This contributes to sociocultural
   perspectives on literacy and use of comics for engaging with narratives

Abstract = {There is limited research on second language (L2) vocabulary teaching
   and learning which provides fine-grained descriptions of how vocabulary
   explanations (VE) are interactionally managed in beginning-level L2
   classrooms where learners have a limited L2 repertoire, and how the VEs
   could contribute to the learners' conceptual understanding of the
   meaning(s) of the target vocabulary items (VIs). To address these
   research gaps, we used a corpus of classroom video data from a
   beginning-level adult ESOL classroom in the United States and applied
   Conversation Analysis to examine how the class teacher employs various
   gestural and linguistic resources to construct L2 VEs. We also conducted
   a 4-month microgenetic analysis to document qualitative changes in
   learners' understanding of the meaning of specific L2 VIs which were
   previously explained by the teacher. Findings revealed that the
   learners' use of gestures allows for an externalisation of thinking
   processes providing visible output for inspection by the teacher and
   peers. These findings can inform educators' understanding about L2
   vocabulary development as a gradual process of controlling the right
   gestural and linguistic resources for appropriate communicative
   purposes.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {14},
Pages = {2367-2390},
Abstract = {To help explain the differences in students' performance on
   internationally administered science assessments, cross-national,
   video-based observational studies have been advocated, but none have yet
   been conducted at the elementary level for science. The USA and Germany
   are two countries with large formal education systems whose students
   underperform those from peers on internationally administered
   standardized science assessments. However, evidence from the 2011 Trends
   in International Mathematics and Science Exam assessment suggests
   fourth-grade students (9-10 year-olds) in the USA perform higher than
   those in Germany, despite more instructional time devoted to elementary
   science in Germany. The purpose of this study is to comparatively
   analyze fourth-grade classroom science in both countries to learn more
   about how teachers and students engage in scientific inquiry,
   particularly explanation-construction. Videorecordings of US and German
   science instruction (n(1) = 42, n(2) = 42) were sampled from existing
   datasets and analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Despite
   German science lessons being, on average, twice as long as those in the
   USA, study findings highlight many similarities between elementary
   science in terms of scientific practices and features of scientific
   inquiry. However, they also illustrate crucial differences around the
   scientific practice of explanation-construction. While students in
   German classrooms were afforded more substantial opportunities to
   formulate evidence-based explanations, US classrooms were more strongly
   characterized by opportunities for students to actively compare and
   evaluate evidence-based explanations. These factors may begin to help
   account for observed differences in student achievement and merit

Abstract = {This paper discusses the results of a research project which aimed to
   capture, analyse and communicate the complex interactions between
   students, teachers and technology that occur in the classroom. Teachers
   and researchers used an innovative research design developed through the
   InterActive Education Project (Sutherland et al., 2003). Video case
   studies were carried out in four classrooms, focusing on the use of
   interactive whiteboard technology for teaching and learning. The case
   studies were analysed using StudioCode, an analytic tool which allows
   researchers to mark and code segments of video data into categories and
   themes. Teachers developed coding systems drawing on the learning aims
   and objectives of their particular lessons. The case studies illustrate
   that the introduction of interactive whiteboards (IWBs) into the
   classroom involves much more than the physical installation of the board
   and software. Teachers are the critical agents in mediating the
   software, the integration of the software into the subject aims of the
   lesson and appropriate use of the IWB to promote quality interactions
   and interactivity.},

Abstract = {Using digital technologies in classrooms goes along with the expectation
   that something will change within interactional contexts of teaching and

   means of video data. The findings of the study provide insights into
   complex configurations of incremental transformation in which
   persistence and change are intertwined at different levels of
   interaction organization: On the one hand, it can be confirmed that the
   inclusion of digital media does not fundamentally shift patterns of
   educational interaction that constitute social order in classroom
   contexts. But on the other hand, it can be shown, that the use of
   tablets mediatizes teaching practices that are realized in group work by
   dealing with modified access to knowledge resources and by referring to
   digitalized knowledge products.},

Abstract = {The dynamic nature of feedback makes provision of learning enhancing

   development case study utilising observational video data from a series

   that arise in giving learning enhancing feedback in an active learning
   setting. The high level of teacher feedback knowledge and positively
   aligned beliefs was found to be contradictory to the feedback practices
   used in the classroom. The analysis showed that consistent provision of
   learning to enhance types of feedback was constrained due to
   environmental and pedagogical tensions. Predominantly, verbal,
   non-specific, positively oriented feedback was shown to be temporally
   situated, with tensions arising from the multiple purposes it serves,
   including classroom management and relationship building. Furthermore,
   despite the merits of a localised, situated professional development
   approach, teacher behavioural change proved complex to achieve. This
   study concluded some types of feedback not characterised as `learning
   enhancing' can offer educational benefits and should not be dismissed.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the contradiction between student agency and
   teacher control in classroom interactions during dialogic teaching. The
   study focused on interactional moments when the students opposed or
   questioned the instructional activity, because it was hypothesized that
   the agency-control contradiction (Rainio, 2008) becomes particularly
   evident in these moments. The video data were collected in a
   heterogeneous Finnish third-grade classroom and analyzed with
   interaction analysis. The results show how promoting student agency is a
   contradictory endeavor that requires balancing between the aspirations
   of dialogic teaching and institutional demands. The results showed that
   the students' criticism and questioning of instructional activity were
   targeted at the contents, procedures, and purpose of the instructional
   activity. We found inconsistency in the teacher's responses to the
   students' opposition according to the type of opposition. Providing
   space for negotiation created opportunities for achieving student
   agency. Conversely, the teacher also silenced students' opposition by
   enforcing his institutional authority or disregarding student
   opposition, resulting in interactions that suppressed student agency.
   This study adds to the understanding of what is at stake when students'
   agency is promoted in classroom interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Over the past decade, abroad range of policymakers, corporations,
   educators, and scholars in the United States have catapulted computer
   science (CS) education from the sidelines to the center of K-12 public
   education discourse. While calls for CS education are often framed in
   terms of national and economic competitiveness, there is a growing
   interest amongst equity scholars in curricular interventions that
   directly engage the ethical and sociopolitical issues surrounding CS and
   its role in society. Yet, less attention has been given to how
   sociocultural dynamics of classrooms play a mediating role in these
   spaces. Drawing on video data from an equity-oriented CS classroom, we
   argue aconflict that arose during design activities was rooted in alack
   of trust and solidarity between students. Ultimately, we make the case
   that in addition to curricular innovations, equity efforts in CS
   education must prioritize the cultivation of positive student
   relationships.},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {Over the past twenty-five years researchers have been concerned with
   understanding the science student. The need for such research is still
   grounded in contemporary issues including providing opportunities for
   all students to develop scientific literacy and the failure of school
   science to connect with student's lives, interests and personal
   identities. The research reported here is unusual in its use of
   discourse analysis in social psychology to contribute to an
   understanding of the way students make meaning in secondary school
   science. Data constructed for the study was drawn from videotapes of
   nine consecutive lessons in a year-seven science classroom in Melbourne,
   post-lesson video-stimulated interviews with students and the teacher,
   classroom observation and the students' written work. The classroom
   videotapes were recorded using four cameras and seven audio tracks by
   the International Centre for Classroom Research at the University of
   Melbourne. Student talk within and about their science lessons was
   analysed from a discursive perspective. Classroom episodes in which
   students expressed their sense of personal identity and agency,
   knowledge, attitude or emotion in relation to science were identified
   for detailed analysis of the function of the discourse used by students,
   and in particular the way students were positioned by others or
   positioned themselves. This article presents the discursive Umwelt or
   life-space of one middle years science student, Tasha. Her case is used
   here to highlight the complex social process of meaning making in
   science classrooms and the need to attend to local moral orders of
   rights and duties in research on student language use, identity and
   learning in science.},

Title = {Exploring features of integrative teaching through a microanalysis of

Journal = {ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {469-495},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The interconnected nature of knowledge in the health sciences is not
   always reflected in how curricula, courses, and learning activities are
   designed. Thus have scholars advocated for more explicit attention to
   connection-making, or integration, in teaching and learning. However,
   conceptual and empirical work to guide such efforts is limited. This
   study analyzed classroom processes to determine what connections
   educators promoted in their classrooms and how those connections were
   made. A qualitative, focused ethnography design explored
   connection-making in a health science curriculum. Eight instructors were
   observed during ten class sessions resulting in 35 h of video data.
   Video data were entered into the observational software, Noldus
   Observer, and coded using continuous sampling. Frequency and duration of
   connections made were calculated in Noldus. Connection-making involved
   four interactive elements: The topic under direct consideration, other
   domains of professional knowledge (practice, student experience,
   research, theory, other content, core construct of the profession,
   external influences, metacognition), the integrative processes
   instructors used to connect a topic to other knowledge domains (informal
   example, stories, questioning, linking statements, formal cases, and
   program descriptions), and the learning and instructor context (type and
   purpose of course, instructor personal and professional experience).
   These elements are presented as an initial integrative learning taxonomy
   that can be used to guide explicit attention to connection-making in
   education and research.},

Abstract = {Emotion regulation is a key developmental skillset, but many existing

   This study aimed to develop a training and implementation protocol for

   system with supplemental guidelines and training procedures was
   developed to use FACES with video data recorded in special education
   classrooms. This system resulted in adequate interrater reliability as
   well as reduced training time for coders. Specific training methods
   included close study of code definitions, coding of practice video,
   quantitative analysis of observation data to generate interrater
   agreement and kappa statistics, review of comparison charts to identify
   discrepancies between coder and training observations using the Noldus
   Observer XT software, and post-observation discussions. The revised
   FACES protocol and new training method presented here offer a more
   robust, efficient, and versatile tool that can be applied to systematic

   mistake-handling. The data include a sample of 30 Italian and 30 US
   videotaped eighth-grade mathematics lessons. The methodology combines a
   discourse analytic approach with quantification of some aspects of the
   interactions observed. The differences observed in Italian and US
   lessons are interpreted as a complex interplay of two elements: beliefs

Journal = {BRITISH EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 12},
Abstract = {Should teachers have complete autonomy over teaching methods and
   practices, or should some aspects of their practice be determined by
   school or government policy? We address this question using repeated
   (value-added) maths test scores linked to rich survey data from the
   TALIS video study. With the possible exception of inexperienced
   teachers, we generally find no relationship between teacher autonomy and
   pupil outcomes (test scores, maths self-efficacy or interest in maths).
   In partial contrast with our findings for pupil outcomes, teachers with
   very low levels of autonomy are more likely to report reduced job
   satisfaction. It may hence be that some level of restriction on teacher
   autonomy is justified, especially among inexperienced teachers,
   particularly when it represents only partial control of teachers'
   approaches in the classroom and is done to introduce evidence-based
   methods.},

Abstract = {This study investigated how student characteristics predict the nature
   of girls' and boys' verbal interactions with their teachers in physics
   classes. The sample included (N = 1378) students from 81 randomly
   selected high-school physics classrooms in Germany and the
   German-speaking part of Switzerland. At the beginning of the school
   year, the following student characteristics were assessed: cognitive
   abilities, pre-knowledge, self-concept, and interest. Each student was
   classified as having one of five profiles previously identified by
   Seidel (2006). Classroom instruction was videotaped four months after
   student characteristics were assessed. The videotaped classroom
   interactions were coded and analyzed with respect to the students'
   profiles. Multilevel analysis indicated the highest amount of verbal
   engagement for girls and boys with high-level cognitive and
   motivational-affective characteristics. There are significant
   interactions between student profile and gender for girls with
   high-level characteristics. We argue that the interaction between gender
   and other characteristics is a valuable predictor of verbal engagement

Abstract = {Is it possible to promote the use of reappraisal as an emotion
   regulation strategy during teachers' processing of classroom
   disruptions? We assume that teachers who are aware of the student
   perspective use reappraisal more often than teachers who are not aware
   of the student perspective. In order to test this hypothesis, we
   presented several video cases that illustrated a problematic classroom
   situation to pre service teachers in an experimental design. In
   addition, we presented supplementary information to the experimental
   group, in which the student who caused the disruption, reflected on
   his/her behavior by commenting on the teaching situation. In contrast,
   the video solely depicting the disruption was shown in the control
   group. Following a thorough stimulus evaluation check (both groups
   showed comparable emotional evaluation of the video cases), it could be
   demonstrated that the experimental group used significantly more
   reappraisal than the control group (eta(2) = 0.13), while suppression
   seemed not to be influenced by the student perspective it was equally
   often used in both groups. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article provides rich insights into the process of data generation
   for discourse analysis from three separate studies of the video

   that multimodal transcription can contribute to developments in
   discourse theory. A three-stage reflective heuristic is developed and
   used in the article to support meta-methodological discussion on
   different researchers' negotiations with the complexity of the video
   data. The focus is how the different researchers attended to modalities
   of meaning making (e.g. speech, learning artefacts, whiteboard notes,
   gestures, bodily actions) and appropriated, adapted and transformed
   their theoretical framework in order to construct the transcripts for
   each study. The three-stage heuristic is shown to facilitate
   transparency in analytic decision-making and is recommended for
   promoting much needed discussion on processes of data generation for
   discourse analysis that draws upon video recordings of action in situ.},

Abstract = {This article explores how opportunities and limitations in creating
   intercontextualtiy between everyday and scientific ideas emerge in
   teacher-student interactions, with a particular focus on the teacher's
   role. The article draws on data from an empirical, longitudinal, study
   in a lower secondary school in Norway to analyze student-teacher
   interactions in regular lessons. The analysis is based on sociocultural
   and dialogical approaches to meaning-making and learning, in which video
   data is subjected to interaction analysis. Our main findings illustrate
   that creating intercontextuality in students' learning trajectories, by
   building on everyday knowledge and experiences as resources for
   classroom interactions, remains a complex task. In the classrooms we
   have followed, the findings show that the teacher's narratives of how to
   frame learning activities and position the students in meaning-making
   process are grounded in teachers' norms and assumptions of what
   constitutes appropriate resources to engage students' in the dialogic
   creation of intercontextuality. These findings have implications for how
   teachers frame learning activities where students get opportunities to
   build upon relevant resources for discussing ideas brought to life in
   complex social interactions.},

Title = {Beliefs as filters for comparing inclusive classroom situations.
   Connecting teachers' beliefs about teaching diverse learners to their
   noticing of inclusive classroom characteristics in videoclips},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY},

Volume = {56},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Insight in the way teachers' beliefs filter their interpretation of
   inclusive classrooms is vital to support teachers' competences to teach
   diverse learners. This study explores how three types of teacher beliefs
   about teaching diverse learners (i.e., professional beliefs about
   diversity, beliefs about differentiating the curriculum, and growth
   mindset) are associated with their noticing of two key aspects of
   effective inclusive classrooms (i.e. positive teacher-student
   interactions (PTSI) and differentiated instruction (DI)). Data was
   collected in a sample of secondary education teachers (N = 462) in
   Flemish schools (N = 23). Teacher beliefs were measured by survey
   scales, while teachers' noticing of PTSI and DI was assessed by a
   standardised video-based comparative judgement instrument. Survey and
   video data were combined in a multivariate multilevel framework.
   Findings indicate that teachers' professional beliefs about diversity
   and beliefs about differentiating the curriculum serve as filters for
   noticing PTSI and DI in videoclips. For teachers' growth mindset no
   significant relationship was found. These associations did not change
   when taking into account teachers' sex, age, educational background or
   experience. Furthermore, a small part of the differences in teachers'
   noticing DI is explained by the school level, suggesting that teachers
   within a school can share a vision. Results are discussed in the light
   of teacher thinking for inclusive classrooms and implications for
   teacher professional development.},

Title = {An explanatory study of kindergarten teachers? teaching behaviours in
   their visual arts classrooms},
Journal = {TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {124},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study aimed at using a mixture of direct observations and
   interviews to investigate kindergarten teachers' knowledge and
   pedagogical approaches to visual arts. An adapted version of the Early
   Child-hood Teacher Behaviour Observation (ECTBO) instrument was used to
   investigate the possible reasons for teachers' current behaviours in
   Hong Kong visual arts classrooms. In an observation study, a total of 18
   classrooms with 76 children in two local kindergartens in Hong Kong were
   observed during a 30-min visual arts activity. Altogether, 540 min of
   video data were recorded and analysed using field notes and a time
   sampling strategy. In addition, 18 class teachers from the observed
   classrooms were invited to give post-observation interviews, and 810 min
   of data were recorded. The interview participants supported the
   importance of non-directive early childhood arts. However, the
   observation findings revealed that they still relied heavily on
   directive teaching in implementing early visual arts teaching. Thus, a
   discrepancy was found between the teachers' subject matter knowledge in
   visual arts and the integration of their pedagogies in their actual
   classroom practice. The findings of this study in a local setting have
   the potential to significantly change the way in which early childhood
   visual arts teaching is conceptualised and discussed in international
   contexts.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Title = {Material inquiry and transformation as prerequisite processes of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Argumentation as a scientific practice has largely been examined along
   an epistemic and/or dialogic perspective in science education research.
   Both perspectives have sidelined the use of real material objects that
   are indispensable for scientists to construct arguments about the
   natural world. To address this gap, this article investigates how
   material objects are used to coordinate with our speech and actions to
   shape argumentation in secondary physical science. Drawing on
   actor-network theory, the article reframes argumentation as a chain of
   human-material interactions incorporating the role of physical things to
   construct evidence. Based on a collective case study comprising
   classroom video data generated from two grade nine science classrooms,
   the article examines how teachers and students used material objects to
   engage in argumentation related to qualitative analysis in chemistry and
   Newton's laws of motions in physics. The analysis reveals two major
   themes: (a) material inquiry as the framing of questions and statements
   about the behavior or property of the material world and (b) material
   transformation as the orchestration of material objects, embodied
   actions, and words to actively create evidence. This article concludes
   that both material inquiry and material transformation are essential
   prerequisites for scientific argumentation to take place, not only in
   research laboratories, but also in science classrooms. The contribution
   to the development of a future socio-material theory of scientific
   argumentation, which takes material agency and multimodal discourse into
   account, are also discussed.},

Journal = {LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {42-53},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Previous research defined and evaluated three basic dimensions of
   instructional quality: classroom management, supportive climate, and
   cognitive activation. This study examined their effects on students'
   situational interest in videotaped biology instruction from German
   sixth-grade classes. Additionally, we evaluated the mediating effects of
   cognitive activation on classroom management and supportive climate
   using multilevel analyses. Each of the 28 biology classes in our sample
   had three lessons videotaped while the topic botany was being taught.
   The three basic dimensions of instructional quality were separately
   examined using respective rating manuals. Multilevel analyses showed
   positive total effects of all the three dimensions on students'
   situational interest. The results also revealed empirical evidence that
   cognitive activation mediated both the effects of classroom management
   and supportive climate on students' situational interest. As our
   findings indicate subject-specific characteristics are necessary to
   foster students' situational interest, we suggest further studies for
   deeper examination and analysis of these characteristics.},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {The present study investigates whether productive classroom discourse in
   the form of instructional and motivational classroom discourse (Turner
   et al., Journal of Educational Psychology 94: 88-106, 2002) provides a
   supportive social context for students that fosters the fulfilment of
   the basic psychological needs of autonomy and competence (Meyer and
   Turner, Educational Psychologist 37(1): 17-25, 2002; Ryan and Deci,
   Contemporary Educational Psychology 25(1): 54-67, 2000). In order to
   explore this, we studied the ways in which a teacher professional
   development programme (Dialogic Video Cycle; Groschner et al. 2015)
   might affect the quality of teachers' instructional and motivational
   discourse. The programme provided video-based professional development
   on productive classroom discourse for an entire school year. During the
   same period of time, we explored changes in students' perceptions of
   autonomy and competence support and possible implications for students'
   intrinsic learning motivation. The study followed a two-group
   field-experiment design; 10 STEM classes participated (N = 226
   students). The intervention group (IG) was compared to a control group
   (CG), which participated in traditional professional development on
   classroom discourse (IG: n (Students) = 136, n (Teachers) = 6; CG: n
   (Students) = 90, n (Teachers) = 4). The results show significant group
   differences in the development of instructional and motivational
   discourse throughout the school year, resulting in significant benefits
   for the IG. Furthermore, the students experienced their teachers as more
   autonomy- and competence-supportive throughout the year, leading to
   increased experiences of self-determination and intrinsic learning
   motivation. The results are discussed in the light of recent research
   and theory.},

Title = {Classroom learning and achievement: how the complexity of classroom
   interaction impacts students' learning},

Abstract = {Background: Complexity models have provided a suitable framework in
   various domains to assess students' educational achievement. Complexity
   is often used as the analytical focus when regarding learning outcomes,
   i.e. when analyzing written tests or problem-centered interviews.
   Numerous studies reveal negative correlations between the complexity of
   a task and the probability of a student solving it.
   Purpose: Thus far, few detailed investigations explore the importance of
   complexity in actual classroom lessons. Moreover, the few efforts made
   so far revealed inconsistencies. Hence, the present study sheds light on
   the influence the complexity of students' and teachers' class
   contributions have on students' learning outcomes.
   Sample: Videos of 10 German 8th grade physics courses covering three
   consecutive lessons on two topics each (electricity, mechanics) have
   been analyzed. The sample includes 10 teachers and 290 students.
   Design and methods: Students' and teachers' verbal contributions were
   coded manual-based according to the level of complexity. Additionally,
   pre-post testing of knowledge in electricity and mechanics was applied
   to assess the students' learning gain. ANOVA analysis was used to
   characterize the influence of the complexity on the learning gain.
   Results: Results indicate that the mean level of complexity in classroom
   contributions explains a large portion of variance in post-test results
   on class level. Despite this overarching trend, taking classroom
   activities into account as well reveals even more fine-grained patterns,
   leading to more specific relations between the complexity in the
   classroom and students' achievement.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, we argue for more reflected teaching
   approaches intended to gradually increase class complexity to foster
   students' level of competency.},

Title = {Investigating scientific modeling practices in US and German elementary
   science classrooms: A comparative, cross-national video study},
Journal = {SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {107},
Number = {2},
Pages = {368-400},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Science education reform efforts have emphasized the incorporation of
   more authentic and meaningful scientific practices into formal learning
   environments. With this focus on practices, such as scientific modeling,
   a powerful tool for sense-making and reasoning, comes a need to observe
   and understand if and how it is actually occurring, particularly in
   elementary science learning environments. To address this need, and
   moving forward an international, collaborative research effort centered
   around scientific modeling, we undertook a cross-national observational
   study in which we used an observation protocol to characterize
   scientific modeling practices in elementary classrooms in both the
   United States and Germany. Drawing on existing video-based datasets from
   multiple projects, this study's findings provide empirical evidence for
   model-based teaching and learning and explore the relative frequencies
   of relevant modeling subpractices (i.e., construction, use, evaluation,
   and revision of scientific models) in regular, day-to-day elementary
   science classrooms. This study also illustrates the differences and
   similarities between German and American science instruction. In
   general, students in both countries experience model construction more
   often than other modeling practices. German teachers more consistently
   foreground anchoring phenomena and students' questions/preconceptions as
   part of the modeling process, thus leading to slightly higher overall
   modeling scores-despite a complete lack of model evaluation and revision
   in any of the observed German classrooms. Ultimately, however, young
   learners in both nations seem to experience alarmingly little
   opportunities to engage in any of the modeling subpractices.
   Particularly in terms of modeling as a means to make sense of phenomena,
   constrained by teachers most commonly using finished representations
   (i.e., models) of phenomena and processes to teach science/deliver
   content. Our results indicate the need for a greater focus on all
   scientific modeling subprocesses, particularly the integration of
   scientific modeling with already established, more general (e.g.,
   inquiry-based) strategies for effective science teaching and an emphasis
   on actualizing modeling as an authentic sense-making endeavor.},

Abstract = {To support individual learning, teachers have to accurately judge
   student characteristics such as pre-achievement and self-concept of

   investigated whether teacher judgment accuracy in interplay with student

Abstract = {This study analyzed the use of Instructional Conversation (IC) in a
   multilingual preschool context. It sought to identify scaffolding
   strategies that promoted the contributions of multilingual children to
   IC. Twenty-seven hours of video data from seven classrooms were
   analyzed. Only three sequences emerged in which multilingual children
   actively contributed to the conversations. Educators in these sequences
   promoted children's contributions by: (a) using multimodal resources,
   (b) responding to the actions and words of the children, and (c)
   focusing on shared meaning-making or intersubjectivity. Translanguaging
   emerged as an important strategy to encourage the involvement of
   multilingual children in IC. Results provide invaluable exemplars of
   effective IC in preschool classrooms with multilingual children. The
   results demonstrate alternative ways of talking with young multilingual
   children and indicate a need for a pedagogical focus away from
   teacher-directed practices to joint activities and responsiveness to
   children's contributions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Verbal teacher student interactions and student characteristics are

   investigated how teacher questions and feedback in relation to
   individual student characteristics and gender predict cognitive learning

   randomly selected high school physics classrooms in Germany and
   Switzerland. Individual student characteristics (cognitive abilities,
   pre-knowledge, self-concept, and interest) were assessed at the
   beginning of the school year to identify five student profiles. Four
   months later, a teaching unit was videotaped in the same classrooms.
   After the teaching unit was videotaped, a questionnaire on cognitive
   learning activity and intrinsic learning motivation was administered.
   Two-level hierarchical models showed that deep-reasoning teacher
   questions and feedback positively predicted both dependent variables and
   the student profiles revealed predictive power for both aspects. Girls
   reported less cognitive learning activity. Our results indicate that
   teaching skills should be fostered to enhance teachers in asking

Volume = {17},
Pages = {56-68},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to examine what resources teachers mobilize
   when contextualizing instruction. In this instructional method, teachers
   use students' everyday experiences as tools for teaching subject matter
   at school. Research has documented that contextualizing instruction can
   support classroom learning. However, we do not know very much about what
   types of resources teachers view as relevant in this kind of
   instructional work. In this article, we analyze video data of
   student-teacher interactions in 43 lessons, which were collected when
   following four lower secondary teachers over one academic year. The
   analysis is based on a sociocultural perspective of learning and
   teaching in which the focus of analysis is on what kind of everyday
   experiences teachers orient to when supporting students' participation.
   The findings show that the resources teachers orient to can be grouped
   into five categories: (1) teachers orienting to characteristics of the
   local community, (2) teachers orienting to examples from everyday
   practices, (3) teachers orienting to personal issues, (4) teachers
   orienting to concrete objects, and (5) teachers orienting to knowledge
   from travelling abroad. These categories show variation and multiplicity
   of resources that teachers use when contextualizing instruction, and the
   implications of this multiplicity are discussed in the article.},

Abstract = {This study reports on the adaptation and outcomes of a teacher
   professional development (TPD) programme in a rural Zimbabwean secondary
   school. The programme incorporated Open Educational Resources (OER),
   specifically OER4school materials, that were provided via tablet
   computers for teachers and students. A mixed-methods case study was
   employed to explore teachers' perceptions, knowledge, experiences of
   interactive learning and teaching in relation to this TPD, as well as
   their perceptions and experiences of the role and value of using
   technology to support student learning. Video data from structured
   lesson observations were triangulated with teacher post-lesson
   interviews and thematically coded. The interviews indicated that all
   teachers demonstrated a change in mindset and a clear understanding of
   interactive teaching methods. However, the structured observations
   revealed that only half of the teachers were using these interactive
   methods. Teachers also emphasised the value of OER and tablet
   technologies in improving lesson planning and making classroom learning
   more authentic. The use of technology, as both a TPD medium and as a
   classroom tool, showed potential to enhance the quality of TPD and
   teacher quality. Yet more specific teacher development to support the
   interactive use of technology within the classroom would be beneficial.},

Abstract = {The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 1999 Video
   Study examined eighth-grade mathematics teaching in the United States
   and six higher-achieving countries. A range of teaching systems were
   found across higher-achieving countries that balanced attention to
   challenging content, procedural skill, and conceptual understanding in
   different ways. The United States displayed a unique system of teaching,
   not because of any particular feature but because of a constellation of
   features that reinforced attention to lower-level mathematics skills.
   The authors argue that these results are relevant for policy
   (mathematics) debates in the United States because they provide a
   current account of what actually is happening inside U.S. classrooms and
   because they demonstrate that current debates often pose overly simple
   choices. The authors suggest ways to learn from examining teaching
   systems that are not alien to U.S. teachers but that balance a skill
   emphasis with attention to challenging mathematics and conceptual
   development.},

Abstract = {When game design is conducted in classrooms as a learning activity, the
   students usually have digital, as well as traditional, artifacts
   available. This article looks at how students organize the use of
   different artifacts when creating computer games about historical
   topics. The data informing this article consist of video data collected
   from one sixth-grade class and one seventh-grade class in Norway. A
   sociocultural perspective is used to show how the students use a
   combination of different artifacts as resources in the game design
   process, focusing on how students take epistemic stances and how the
   artifacts are given different epistemic status. The students jointly
   construct knowledge that they then integrate into computer games using
   artifacts such as textbooks, world maps, Google, and timelines. The
   article shows how designing games about historical topics is a complex
   process in which students use artifacts as the basis for knowledge
   claims and storytelling, and students need to negotiate and balance
   their own design preferences with historical accuracy and the
   expectations of the classroom setting.},

Abstract = {Given the globalization of science education and the different cultures
   between China and Germany, we tried to compare and explain the
   differences on teacher questions and real life instances in biology
   lessons between the two countries from a culture-related perspective. 22
   biology teachers from China and 21 biology teachers from Germany
   participated in this study. Each teacher was videotaped for one lesson
   on the unit blood and circulatory system. Before the teaching unit,
   students' prior knowledge was tested with a pretest. After the teaching
   unit, students' content knowledge was tested with a posttest. The aim of
   the knowledge tests here was for the better selection of the four
   samples for qualitative comparison in the two countries. The
   quantitative analysis showed that more lower-order teacher questions and
   more real life instances that were introduced after learning relevant
   concepts were in Chinese lessons than in German lessons. There were no
   significant differences in the frequency of higher-order questions or
   real life instances that were introduced before learning concepts.
   Qualitative analysis showed that both German teachers guided students to
   analyze the reasoning process of Landsteiner experiment, but nor Chinese
   teachers did that. The findings reflected the subtle influence of
   culture on classroom teaching. Relatively, Chinese biology teachers
   focused more on learning content and the application of the content in
   real life; German biology teachers emphasized more on invoking students'
   reasoning and divergent thinking.},

   interaction between the agent, and cultural tools. Three scenes were
   analyzed using narrative and micro-analytic strategies. Analyses of two
   scenes highlighted how social and material mediators offer opportunities
   for engagement. Other children with autism provided appropriate
   scaffolds and demonstrated evidence of intersubjectivity, whereas
   material tools provided proximal prompts that enabled the child to
   engage. The third scene suggests that engagement may not always be
   observable (i.e., engagement may be a subjective state). Implications

Title = {Exploring the materiality of science learning: analytical frameworks for
   examining interactions with material objects in science meaning-making},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 13},
Abstract = {BackgroundWith a growing new materialism paradigm and research on
   multimodality, there is an increasing attention on the role of material
   objects in science teaching and learning. However, there is currently no
   available framework, coding scheme, or method of inquiry to specifically
   analyze the use of material objects in science
   meaning-making.PurposeThis paper presents and discusses two analytical
   frameworks developed to examine teachers' and students' interaction with
   material objects during classroom discourse.Design and methodsThe first
   analytical framework was theoretically informed by multimodal
   interaction analysis (MIA), focusing on humans' situated interaction
   using embodied and disembodied modes located in the material world. The
   second framework was informed by social semiotics multimodal analysis
   (SSMA), focusing on material interaction as a semiotic mode with unique
   affordances for sign-makers to make meaning alongside other semiotic
   modes (e.g. speech, gesture).SampleBoth frameworks are used to analyze
   two vignettes of classroom discourse generated from video data to
   illustrate their applications, coding procedures, and interpretative
   potential.ResultsThe MIA-informed framework highlighted the dynamic and
   reciprocal relations between students' experiences and the
   transformation of materials, while the SSMA-informed framework
   highlighted the subtle meanings constructed with the unique affordances
   of the material mode.ConclusionThe affordances and limitations of the
   two frameworks are discussed, along with their compatibility and
   complementary relations. This work contributes to the emerging field of
   materiality in science education research and provides a foundation for
   future studies on the analysis of material interaction in science
   meaning-making.},

Abstract = {Background Bringing about conceptual change in school science classrooms
   is difficult for teachers. Researchers in this field have struggled to
   influence classroom practice. Purpose The present research presents a
   method and a framework for video-based pedagogy analysis. Sample Six
   groups of 11-year-old pupils took part (three girls and three boys) in
   each expert micro-teaching interview, led by a science specialist
   (Advanced Skills Teacher). A `Concurrent Verbal Protocol and
   Retrospective Debriefing' interview happened with the teacher
   approximately one month later. Six teachers and thirty-six pupils
   participated altogether. Design and method Three research methods
   (expert micro-teaching, verbal protocols and retrospective debriefing)
   were used. Data were video-recorded and managed using NVivo. About
   fifteen hours of video data were analysed using grounded theory methods.
   The interpretivist theoretical perspective (symbolic interactionism) was
   underpinned by a social constructionist epistemology. What can be
   considered evidence is inevitably affected by the researcher's
   methodological position. So what constitutes reliable evidence can be
   contentious. Appropriate criteria for evaluating the grounded theory
   emerging from this study were used. Interpretivist approaches for
   investigating conceptual change in school science are necessary to
   complement positivist literature. This approach, proved successful in
   other fields, is new to this context. Data were recorded in 2013.
   Results Findings are presented as a Pedagogy Analysis Framework which
   uses the concepts: means (including information, misinformation and
   disinformation), strategy (on a spectrum from micro-strategies, through
   tactics to macro-strategies;), ends (physical changes, individual mental
   changes and group mental changes), and accidents. Conclusions The method
   allows teachers to help the researcher understand incidents in
   video-data that are not evident to any external observer. The framework
   could help strategic dialogue between teachers, student teachers,
   mentors, teacher educators, and educational researchers.},

Abstract = {In this study, we use a transmodal lens to investigate how emergent

   presentations. We also investigate the role of translanguaging in
   support of children's communication and interaction in this activity.
   Video data of show-and-tell activity in two dual language preschool
   classrooms were analyzed for the actional, verbal, and visual modes used
   by children as well as for features of their transmodal repertoire.
   Qualitative analyses revealed specific patterns in EB children's
   employment of multimodal resources, in response to presentation purposes
   and show-and-tell routines and structures. Children's translanguaging
   practices were flexible and supported their presentation purposes and
   participation across show-and-tell routines. Findings have implications
   for ways of facilitating show-and-tell and how teachers can promote
   students' transmodal practices in support of their learning and
   engagement in this activity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Infants' effects on adults are a little studied but important aspect of
   development. What do infants do that increases caregiver responsiveness
   in childcare environments? Infants' communicative behaviors (i.e.
   smiling, crying) affect mothers' responsiveness; and preschool
   children's language abilities affect teachers' responses in the
   classroom setting. However, the effects of infants' intentional
   communications on either parents' or non-parental caregivers'
   responsiveness have not been examined. Using longitudinal video data
   from an infant classroom where infant signing was used along with
   conventional gestures (i.e. pointing), this study examines whether
   infants' use of gestures and signs elicited greater responsiveness from
   caregivers during daily interactions. Controlling child age and
   individual child effects, infants' gestures and signs used specifically
   to respond to caregivers elicited more responsiveness from caregivers
   during routine interactions. Understanding the effects of infants'
   behaviors on caregivers is critical for helping caregivers understand
   and improve their own behavior towards children in their care. (C) 2009

Journal = {LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {80},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Our aim was to complement results obtained using interview data (Zorn \&
   Puustinen, 2017a) by analyzing video data on the same students' (i.e.,
   11 students with ASD) actual help-seeking behavior as well as their
   teachers' (n = 17) subsequent help-giving behavior, in everyday
   classroom situations in both general and resource class within a
   mainstream lower secondary school. Ten students sought help from their
   teachers at least once in both contexts, yet interpersonal differences
   were observed. Although student help seeking partly fell into
   ``traditional `` help-seeking categories (i.e., instrumental help
   seeking, confirmation-asking), new help-seeking categories also emerged
   (i.e., ambiguous and organizational help seeking). Students always used
   verbal means to solicit help; in addition, both nonverbal and verbal
   means to draw teachers' attention were identified. More than 70\% of
   help giving consisted of providing direct feedback, explaining, or
   instructing. The importance of analyzing the help seeking process in an
   ecologically valid context is emphasized.},

Title = {Effects of Interaction Qualities Beyond Task Quality: Disentangling
   Instructional Support and Cognitive Demands},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 1},
Abstract = {Instructional quality dimensions of cognitive demands and instructional
   support have been shown to have an impact on students' learning gains.
   Existing operationalizations of these dimensions have mostly used
   comprehensive ratings that combine various subdimensions of task quality
   and interaction quality. The current study disentangles interaction
   quality in a video data corpus study (of 49 middle school classrooms
   sharing the same tasks) to identify those quality features that predict
   students' learning gains in conceptual understanding. The regression
   analysis reveals that quality features of students' individual
   engagement do not predict individual student learning, whereas teachers'
   support of learning content-relevant vocabulary predicts the small
   groups' learning. For at-risk students, the collective time spent on
   conceptual practices (i.e. explaining meanings of concepts) on students'
   learning is significantly predictive. The observation that different
   operationalizations (for similar aspects of interaction quality) lead to
   different impacts on the learning gains contributes to ongoing research
   efforts to refine and increase insight into aspects of interaction
   quality.},

Journal = {RESEARCH PAPERS IN EDUCATION},

Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {561-598},
Abstract = {This paper considers the development and randomised control trial (RCT)
   of a dialogic teaching intervention designed to maximise the power of
   classroom talk to enhance students' engagement and learning. Building on
   the author's earlier work, the intervention's pedagogical strand
   instantiates dialogic teaching not as a single, circumscribed method'
   but as an interlocking set of permissive repertoires through which,
   steered by principles of procedure, teachers energise their own and
   their students' talk. The repertoires are directed both to teaching's
   improvement and to its larger epistemological, cultural and civic
   purposes. Its professional strand entailed teacher induction and
   training followed by a cyclic programme of planning, target-setting and
   review using mentoring and video/audio analysis. Supported by the UK
   Education Endowment Foundation it was piloted in London and trialled in
   three other UK cities with combined intervention/control cohorts of
   nearly 5000year 5 (4th grade) students and 208 teachers. The independent
   evaluation calculated that after 20weeks students in the intervention
   group were two months ahead of their control group peers in English,
   mathematics and science tests; while coded video data showed that the
   changes in both teacher and student talk were striking and in the
   direction intended. The RCT methodology affords limited explanatory
   purchase but insights are available from other studies. These, together
   with contingent questions and future possibilities, are discussed in the
   paper's conclusion.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to examine peer tutoring models in
   collaborative learning of mathematical problem solving (MPS) in flipped
   classrooms and their effect on group achievement. Quantitative data
   collected include 32 videos of eight groups of students in four MPS
   periods that were designed based on a simplified version of Polya's
   four-stage model, and their worksheets completed in each period. The
   video data were coded based on a framework with low-level and high-level
   cognitive behaviors as well as management behaviors and were analyzed
   using lag sequence analysis from which three types of peer tutoring
   models were determined: organization-oriented, cognitive-supported, and
   cognitive-guided. ANOVA analysis showed that the groups with
   cognitive-guided tutors performed significantly better than the groups
   guided by cognitive-supported and organization-oriented tutors, between
   which the performance difference did not reach a significant level. The
   results of this study suggest that training provided to peer tutors
   should focus more on how to stimulate high-level cognitive thinking
   skills than on organization skills.},

Title = {Race talk tensions: practicing racial literacy in a fourth-grade
   classroom},
Journal = {ENGLISH TEACHING-PRACTICE AND CRITIQUE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {61-78},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {PurposeThere is a pressing need to teach students how to talk critically
   about race to understand the personal and political implications of
   racism in the contemporary US society. Classroom race talk, however,
   often includes moments of discomfort or confusion as teachers and
   students navigate new norms for making sense of race and racism. The
   purpose of this paper is to examine how one white teacher and her
   multiracial class of fourth-grade students navigated race talk tensions
   while reading and discussing shared texts.
   Design/methodology/approachData for this paper were collected as part of
   a larger, year-long qualitative study on antiracist pedagogy. In this
   paper, the author analyzes video data of classroom race talk recorded
   during whole-class and small-group literacy lessons. Using inductive
   coding and reconstructive critical discourse analysis, the author
   examines how the teacher and students co-constructed meaning during
   tense or confusing conversational moments. FindingsThe findings
   demonstrate that the teacher and students jointly mediated tensions by
   using the practices of racial literacy, which included learning about
   the history of racial inequality in the USA, considering racism as
   structural and systemic rather than individual and asking and answering
   questions for continued inquiry and critical self-reflection. While
   previous research studies have characterized race talk tensions as
   problems or obstacles to student learning, the findings from this study
   suggest that tensions can be generative to developing and enacting
   racial literacy. Originality/valueIn the current political climate,
   alarmist rhetoric issued by conservative politicians and media outlets
   has discredited race talk as harmful or damaging to children. This study
   offers a positive reframing of tensions, which may provide teachers
   encouragement to pursue literacy instruction that equips students with
   knowledge and skills to better understand and confront racism.},

Abstract = {To enable teaching to take place as a teacher-learner interaction, the
   participants must mutually coordinate their behaviour. The teaching
   staff in particular are expected to take responsibility for the results
   of such coordination processes, i.e. for the sequence of activities
   which take place from one moment to the next in lessons. But how do they
   manage to control the actions of the learners and thus create
   (dis)continuity in the lessons? This question, which is rooted in the
   tradition of classroom management, is all the more relevant if the
   learners cannot be assumed to be willing to comply or if compliance
   cannot be easily demanded-which applies to some extent to teaching
   events for adults. In this article, the results of a microethnographic
   video study are presented to show the methods which the participants use
   at the beginning of adult and vocational education courses to influence
   the actions of other persons. A case study is used to illustrate how the
   teacher deals with problems in classroom flow control by the
   contextually appropriate use of various regulation methods, and thus
   plays a role in creating the (dis)continuity which shapes the sequence
   of events in the lessons. This especially underlines the potential of
   non-verbal forms of expression to herald a change of activities. This
   approach to research involves a shift in the perspective of adult
   education professionalism research from the ex-post analysis of
   professional knowledge to the in-situ observation of professional
   skills. With the aid of video-based (micro-)ethnographic approaches, the
   forms which the teaching staff routinely use to deal with specific
   action requirements are made visible with a high degree of empirical
   resolution. This extends the application of ethnographic methods. The
   classroom management discourse from school teaching is brought into a
   theoretical and empirical dialogue with course and interaction research
   in adult education. And finally, this creates a basis which enables the
   appropriateness of educational action variants to be discussed in an
   empirically meaningful way in the light of normative teaching theories.},

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {108},

Pages = {533-551},

Abstract = {Feedback provided by mathematics teachers usually addresses procedural
   skills and, to a much lesser extent, other competencies such as
   conceptual understanding or engagement in mathematical practices. As
   most previous literature has studied feedback provided on homework or
   video prompts, how teachers provide such feedback in the classroom is
   poorly understood. Here, sixteen lessons taught by five teachers were
   purposefully sampled from a larger video study (172 lessons) as lessons
   with high-quality feedback according to a standardized observation
   instrument. The analysis focused on the instructional situations in
   which teachers provided feedback. When teachers provided procedural
   feedback, the situations were orderly and effective. Feedback on
   conceptual understanding and mathematical practices was provided in
   situations when students were especially challenged, and entailed a
   series of complex decisions, thereby placing demands on the teachers to
   manage both the students' understanding and behavior. We argue that
   researchers should focus on how teachers and students negotiate the
   instructional situation to allow for feedback on conceptual
   understanding or mathematical practices.},

Title = {Instructional Quality Features in Videotaped Biology Lessons:
   Content-Independent Description of Characteristics},

Abstract = {A number of studies on single instructional quality features have been
   reported for mathematics and science instruction. For summarizing single
   instructional quality features, researchers have created a model of
   three basic dimensions (classroom management, supportive climate, and
   cognitive activation) of instructional quality mainly through observing
   mathematics instruction. Considering this model as valid for all
   subjects and as usable for describing instruction, we used it in this
   study which aimed to analyze characteristics of instructional quality in
   biology lessons of high-achieving and low-achieving classes,
   independently of content. Therefore, we used the data of three different
   previous video studies of biology instruction conducted in Germany. From
   each video study, we selected three high-achieving and three
   low-achieving classes (N = 18 teachers; 35 videos) for our multiple-case
   study, in which conspicuous characteristics of instructional quality
   features were qualitatively identified and qualitatively analyzed. The
   amount of these characteristics was counted in a quantitative way in all
   the videos. The characteristics we found could be categorized using the
   model of three basic dimensions of instructional quality despite some
   subject-specific differences for biology instruction. Our results
   revealed that many more characteristics were observable in
   high-achieving classes than in low-achieving classes. Thus, we believe
   that this model could be used to describe biology instruction
   independently of the content. We also make the claims about the
   qualities for biology instruction-working with concentration in a
   content-structured environment, getting challenged in higher order
   thinking, and getting praised for performance-that could have positive
   influence on students' achievement.},

Title = {Task type completion in lower level EFL classes: A conversation analytic
   study},
Journal = {LANGUAGE TEACHING RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 FEB 2},
Abstract = {This study assesses a range of task-based interaction (i.e. structured
   vs. unstructured tasks) between lower-English-proficiency middle school
   English as a foreign language (EFL) learners in a task-based learning
   (TBL) class employing conversation analytic methodology. From the video
   data, which allowed for an emic analysis of the students' vocal and
   non-vocal actions when engaging in the different task types, it was
   found that in both the structured and unstructured task interactions,
   because the students were mainly focused on task completion, there were
   frequent minimal turns and sequences. A deviant case analysis revealed
   that the participants prioritized task completion as the focus of
   activities even when engaging in social talk by evoking various types of
   roles (e.g. students, friends). The study proposes several pedagogical
   suggestions for employing tasks in lower-level EFL contexts.},

Abstract = {While there are several positive outcomes from implementing game design
   in a formal learning context, there are also challenges that have to be
   considered in order to improve game-based learning. This is explored in
   the article, using the concepts of activity frames and stancetaking,
   focusing on the social organization of the game design activity.
   Building on video data from one 6th grade class and one 7th grade class
   designing computer games based on their social studies curriculum, this
   article shows that tensions arise when students fail to agree on what
   the activity they are doing is really about: The academic content and
   what students commonly perceive as school activities, or a game design
   activity informed by their leisure time. The main argument is that the
   students position themselves as students, game designers or characters,
   and that this may cause tensions in the students' social interactions.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to challenge primary school science teachers'

   Pre- and post-intervention surveys were administered to examine possible
   changes in the participants' beliefs about education and science
   teaching efficacy. Video data were gathered through classroom
   observations of 9 participants from the experimental group and 9
   participants from the control group. The results of one-way analysis of
   covariance indicate that the reported post-intervention beliefs of
   teachers who participated in the programme differed significantly from
   their pre-intervention beliefs. More specifically, teachers in the
   experimental groups reported fewer traditional and more constructivist
   beliefs after the intervention, as well as stronger personal science
   teaching efficacy beliefs. One exception included beliefs about science
   teaching outcome expectancy. The video data showed that teaching
   practices became more constructivist in terms of both practical

Title = {Teachers' Use of Focus Questions in German Biology Classrooms: a

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of teachers' use of focus questions
   on students' knowledge structures and classroom teaching-learning
   process by re-analyzing selected data from a quasi-experimental pre-post
   video study (Wadouh, 2007). Focus questions are content-related
   anchoring questions highlighting the key content taught in individual
   lessons (Forbes \& Davis, 2010). In Wadouh' study, students answered a
   knowledge test before and after the lesson on blood and the circulatory
   system and one lesson per teacher was videotaped to investigate teaching
   practices in grade 9 biology classrooms. Students also completed a
   post-unit concept mapping exercise and a motivation-interest
   questionnaire. In this study, 30 lesson videos selected from 47 were
   re-analyzed for teachers' use of focus questionsno focus questions,
   non-specific or simple focus questions, and specific and challenging
   focus questions. Individual students' scores in the concept mapping
   exercise were aggregated as students' topic-related knowledge structure.
   Multilevel analyses revealed a significant positive effect of teachers'
   use of specific and challenging focus questions on students'
   topic-related knowledge structure. Furthermore, a comparative case
   analysis of the classroom teaching-learning process was conducted in
   four lessons where teachers used specific and challenging focus
   questions in two of the lessons and non-specific or simple focus
   questions in the other two lessons. The findings indicate that specific
   and challenging focus questions anchored lessons on students'
   co-construction of scientific explanations by activating their
   pre-instructional ideas, whereas non-specific or simple focus questions
   anchored lessons on their accumulation of canonical scientific
   knowledge. This study's limitations and implications for teacher
   education reform are discussed.},

Abstract = {The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) Video
   Study explored instructional practices in the United States (US) in
   comparison with other countries that ranked higher on the 1999 TIMSS
   assessment, and revealed that 8(th) grade science teachers in the US
   emphasize activities over content during lessons (Roth et al. 2006).
   This study applies the content framework from the TIMSS Video Study to a
   sample of 28 3(rd) grade teachers enacting an inquiry-based unit on
   floating and sinking, and seeks a deeper understanding of teachers'
   practices through analysis of interviews with those teachers.
   Transcripts of observed lessons were coded according to the TIMSS
   framework for types of content, and transcripts of teacher interviews
   were coded to capture the ways in which teachers described their role in
   and purposes for teaching science, particularly with respect to the
   floating and sinking unit. Results indicate that teachers focused more
   on canonical, procedural and experimental knowledge during lessons than
   on real-world connections and the nature of science; however, none of
   the types of content received major emphasis in a majority of the
   classrooms in the sample. During interviews, teachers described their
   practice in ways that prioritized helping students to like science over
   specific content outcomes. The study suggests that elementary school
   teachers' emphasis on doing and feeling during inquiry-based lessons may
   interfere with teaching of content.},

Title = {Positioning video in classroom research: Ontological and epistemic
   tensions},
Journal = {LEARNING CULTURE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While the use of video as a data collection tool in classroom-based
   research is widespread, a tension exists between different approaches to
   the use of video as a research tool. Researchers vary in the ontological
   status that they afford video footage and the way they use footage to
   construct knowledge claims. This paper presents a set of metaphors that
   describe how video may be positioned in research projects in order to
   identify the ontological status afforded video data and the epistemic
   implications this entails. We argue that the different ways that video
   is posi-tioned in projects lead to the footage collected having
   different ontological status and we present three illustrative example
   projects to exemplify these differences. Applying the metaphors to the
   example projects reveals a tension between the researchers' carefully
   constructed framing of ontological and epistemic positions. Our analysis
   suggests that using footage as evidence to support knowledge claims
   privileges an ontological and epistemic position which views video
   footage as a replayable record of sense data, align with a positivist
   position. In each illustrative project, the ontological status of
   footage was layered - it was both an objective record of activities of
   interest, but also was treated as a subjective and fallible data source
   when used to construct claims about teacher experience. Our analysis
   highlighted the complexity in the use of the video as a research tool
   for classroom research and the need for more nuanced ontological and
   epistemic understanding to make informed decisions in research design
   and to support knowledge claims.},

Title = {Influence of using challenging tasks in biology classrooms on students'

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1882-1903},
Abstract = {Empirical analysis of secondary biology classrooms revealed that, on
   average, 68\% of teaching time in Germany revolved around processing
   tasks. Quality of instruction can thus be assessed by analyzing the
   quality of tasks used in classroom discourse. This quasi-experimental
   study analyzed how teachers used tasks in 38 videotaped biology lessons
   pertaining to the topic `blood and circulatory system'. Two fundamental
   characteristics used to analyze tasks include: (1) required cognitive
   level of processing (e.g. low level information processing: repetiition,
   summary, define, classify and high level information processing:
   interpret-analyze data, formulate hypothesis, etc.) and (2) complexity
   of task content (e.g. if tasks require use of factual, linking or
   concept level content). Additionally, students' cognitive knowledge
   structure about the topic ` blood and circulatory system' was measured
   using student-drawn concept maps (N = 970 students). Finally, linear
   multilevel models were created with high-level cognitive processing
   tasks and higher content complexity tasks as class-level predictors and
   students' prior knowledge, students' interest in biology, and students'
   interest in biology activities as control covariates. Results showed a
   positive influence of high-level cognitive processing tasks (beta =
   0.07; p<.01) on students' cognitive knowledge structure. However, there
   was no observed effect of higher content complexity tasks on students'
   cognitive knowledge structure. Presented findings encourage the use of
   high-level cognitive processing tasks in biology instruction.},

Abstract = {The growing diversity in pupil populations poses challenges to the
   professional development of student teachers. Therefore, teacher
   preparation has placed sufficient emphasis on the development of student
   teachers' professional vision in the context of inclusive education. In
   this study, professional vision refers to student teachers ability to
   notice and reason about classroom events that are crucial for effective
   inclusive teaching. This study explores student teachers' professional
   vision of two dimensions of effective inclusive classrooms (i.e.
   teacher-student interactions (TSI) and differentiated instruction (DI))
   by examining different profiles of professional vision and its relation
   with student teachers' professional beliefs about diversity and
   self-efficacy in implementing inclusive practices. Data was collected in
   a sample of 1397 student teachers in Flemish primary teacher education
   institutions (N = 8). Student teachers' professional vision was assessed
   by a standardised video-based comparative judgement instrument, while
   student teachers' beliefs and self-efficacy were measured by survey
   scales. Survey and video data were combined through cluster analysis and
   regression analysis. Findings indicate three different profiles of
   professional vision among student teachers. Differences between student
   teachers' professional vision profiles is explained by their
   self-efficacy. However, the results of the cluster analyses did not
   produce a group of student teachers with high abilities in both noticing
   and reasoning about TSI and DI. This implies that teacher education
   programmes need to more adequately train student teachers for inclusive
   education. Recommendations for teacher education programmes on inclusive
   primary education are given.},

   for student questioning. The fidelity of structure and the process of
   implementation were verified by interviews, video data and a product
   collection. Results show that the scenario was relevant for teachers,
   practical in use and effective for guiding student questioning. Results
   also suggest that shared responsibility for classroom mind maps
   contributed to more intensive collective knowledge construction.},

Abstract = {With regard to the moderate performance of German students in
   international large-scale assessments, one branch of German science
   education research is concerned with the construction and evaluation of
   competence models. Based on the theory-driven definition of competence
   levels, these models imply a correlation between the complexity of a
   question or a problem, its difficulty and the cognitive demands that are
   required to answer or solve it. The aim of the study was to apply two
   competence models in order to analyse the complexity of questions that
   chemistry teachers use to promote learning in class as well as to
   compare the results of this analysis. Two model-based coding schemes
   were constructed and evaluated on the basis of interrater reliability
   before analysing the teacher questions in 40 chemistry lessons. The
   results show that between 60 and 65 \% of the questions refer to low
   complexity levels. Although there is a considerable correspondence
   between the results (69.2 \%), neither model can be considered as
   redundant. These findings are discussed with regard to the level and the
   development of students' skills in science.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of music
   practice instruction on middle school band students' ability to
   articulate and incorporate practice strategies. Participants were middle
   school band students at a large suburban middle school (N= 105). Using a
   pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design, participants were divided
   into control (n= 53) and experimental (n= 52) groups. Participants in
   the experimental group received 3 weeks of practice strategy instruction
   during ensemble warm-up time, and the control group continued with their
   typical warm-up routine. Pretest and posttest data included
   self-reported practice strategy lists (N= 105) and video of individual
   practice sessions (n= 20). Both self-reported and video data were coded
   and analyzed using descriptive statistics as well as pretest-posttest
   within-groups comparisons. Thirteen hours of video data were further
   analyzed using an observational measure of self-regulation. Analyses
   revealed that experimental group participants identified and utilized
   significantly more practice strategies following the instructional
   intervention. Posttest experimental group practice sessions also
   revealed a more mature approach to practicing, including more strategic
   behaviors, greater variety in musical objectives, and longer periods
   spent focused on short excerpts of music. Implications for future
   research and middle school instrumental classroom practice are
   discussed.},

Title = {Wounded Healing: Forming a Storytelling Community in Hip-Hop Lit},
Journal = {TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {111},
Number = {1},
Pages = {248-293},
Abstract = {Background/Context: Over the past 5 years, there has been a growing body
   of scholarship that examines the intersections of hip-hop culture and
   classroom pedagogy. Although recent scholarship has persuasively
   demonstrated the classroom potential of hip-hop texts for promoting
   student engagement, scaffolding sanctioned forms of knowledge, and
   nurturing critical consciousness and activism, little work has been done
   to unpack the complex relations of power that emerge in such classrooms.
   In particular, we know very little about the ways in which students and
   teachers are (re) positioned within classrooms that engage in
   hip-hop-centered pedagogy. This article contributes to the current
   literature in hip-hop based education, culturally relevant pedagogy, and
   critical pedagogy by examining the some of the issues and tensions that
   emerge when teachers engage in hip-hop-centered classroom pedagogy.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study details
   how the articulation of personal narratives within Hip-Hop Lit, a
   hip-hop-centered high school English literature course, produced a
   practice of ``wounded healing,{''} in which people bearing the scars of
   suffering shared their stories in ways that provided a form of release
   and relief for themselves and others. This article highlights the
   complex relationships that students forged with the course's hip-hop
   texts, many of which resonated with their own lived experiences. I then
   illustrate how these relationships enabled the classroom discussions and
   interactions from which the practices of wounded healing emerged.
   Finally, I highlight some of the dilemmas and tensions that emerged as
   my coteacher and I attempted to privilege the stories and experiences of
   our students and ourselves within the classroom.
   Setting: Data for this study were collected at ``Howard High School,{''}
   a small comprehensive urban high school in the northeastern United
   States.
   Research Design: Data for this 1-year ethnography were collected using
   field notes, formal and informal interviews, document analysis, and
   video data.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: This article shows how Hip-Hop Lit operated
   as a space in which members offered and responded to various types of
   individual and group narratives through the practice of ``wounded
   healing.{''} Through this practice, students were able to recognize the
   commonality of their experiences, challenge various ideologies, and
   produce new knowledge. In doing this, the members of the class forged a
   cohesive community replete with multiple roles and relations of power.
   This article points to the need for critically interrogating the
   ostensible virtues of hip-hop-based education, as well as critical and
   culturally relevant pedagogies more broadly. This article also
   underscores the need for more ethnographic research that unpacks the
   complexities, contours, and contradictions of curricula, and pedagogy
   that responds to the lived experiences of students.},

Abstract = {In this reflective methodological paper we focus on affordances and
   challenges of video data. We compare and analyze two research settings
   that use the latest video technology to capture classroom interactions
   in mathematics education, namely, The Social Unit of Learning (SUL)
   project of the University of Melbourne and the MathTrack project of the
   University of Helsinki. While using these two settings as examples, we
   have structured our reflections around themes pertinent to video
   research in general, namely, research methods, data management, and
   research ethics. SUL and MathTrack share an understanding of mathematics
   learning as social multimodal practice, and provide possibilities for
   zooming into the situational micro interactions that construct
   collaborative problem-solving learning. Both settings provide rich data
   for in-depth analyses of peer interactions and learning processes. The
   settings share special needs for technical support and data management,
   as well as attention to ethical aspects from the perspective of the
   participants' security and discretion. SUL data are especially suitable
   for investigating interactions on a broad scope, addressing how multiple
   interactional processes intertwine. MathTrack, on the other hand,
   enables exploration of participants' visual attention in detail and its
   role in learning. Both settings could provide tools for teachers'
   professional development by showing them aspects of classroom

Title = {Elements of instruction that motivate students with learning

Journal = {MATHEMATICAL THINKING AND LEARNING},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUN 18},
Abstract = {Despite the documented influence of motivation on mathematics learning
   for most students, we understand far less about this relation for
   students identified with learning disabilities. Based on Rogoff's three
   planes of analysis (i.e., personal, community, and interpersonal), we
   gathered survey, interview, and video data to understand the motivations
   of sixth graders in a special education mathematics classroom as well as
   classroom conditions that supported motivation during a unit on
   fractions. By the end of that unit, students reported improved ability
   beliefs and attributed the changes to increased conceptual understanding
   of fractions, exposure to strategies for sense making, and the
   additional time and assistance provided to them. Through video analysis,
   we also found that having students verbalize their thinking about the
   mathematics can provide opportunities to identify remediation needs and
   thus support productive participation and positive ability beliefs.
   These findings highlight the motivational value of effective mathematics
   instruction for students with learning disabilities.},

Abstract = {The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of a video
   feedback coaching intervention for upper-grade primary school teachers
   on students' cognitive gains in scientific knowledge. This teaching
   intervention was designed with the use of inquiry-based learning
   principles for teachers, such as the empirical cycle and the posing of
   thought-provoking questions. The intervention was put into practice in
   10 upper-grade classrooms. The trajectory comprised four lessons,
   complemented with two premeasures and two postmeasures. The control
   condition consisted of 11 upper-grade teachers and their students. The
   success of the intervention was tested using an established standardized
   achievement test and situated measures. In this way, by means of
   premeasure and postmeasure questionnaires and video data, an assessment
   could be made of the change in students' scientific knowledge before,
   during, and after the intervention. In this study, we primarily focused
   on the dynamics of students' real-time expressions of scientific
   knowledge in the classroom. Important indicators of the effect of the
   intervention were found. Through focusing on the number of explanations
   and predictions, a significant increase could be seen in the proportion
   of students' utterances displaying scientific understanding in the
   intervention condition. In addition, students in the intervention
   condition more often reasoned on higher complexity levels than students
   in the control condition. No effect was found for students' scientific
   knowledge as measured with a standardized achievement test. Implications
   for future studies are stressed, as well as the importance of enriching
   the evaluation of intervention studies by focusing on dynamics in the
   classroom.},

Title = {Explicit instruction on procedural and epistemic knowledge - is it
   happening? A video-based exploration of classroom practice},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 24},
Abstract = {BackgroundInquiry-based instruction is a prominent teaching strategy in
   science education that is assumed to be an effective means to foster not
   only students' understanding of science content but also their
   procedural and epistemic knowledge concerning inquiry processes.
   Empirical studies have repeatedly shown that inquiry-related activities
   should be combined with instruction that explicitly addresses procedural
   and epistemic knowledge to support students' learning
   effectively.PurposeThe aim of this study is to explore to what extent
   explicit instruction on procedural and epistemic knowledge is occurring
   in inquiry-based biology and chemistry lessons.SampleThe sample analysed
   in this study consist of 16 inquiry-based biology and chemistry lessons
   recorded in German classrooms.Design and MethodsThe video recordings of
   the lessons were analysed in three steps. First, event-based codes were
   used to identify all phases of a lesson in which students were engaged
   in an inquiry-related activity (e.g. developing questions, planning
   investigations). Second, each phase was analysed with respect to
   features of explicit instruction (e.g. explications of inquiry
   strategies). Third, event-based codes were used to capture individual
   features of explicit instruction in a phase.ResultsIn our sample
   explicit instruction on procedural knowledge occurred rarely and mostly
   in the form of brief sidenotes rather than as a comprehensive and
   deliberately planned action. Furthermore, explicit instruction on
   epistemic knowledge was virtually non-existent. However, we observed
   that many tasks and questions that are given by the teachers during
   their lessons have a high potential for making procedural (and
   epistemic) aspects explicit.ConclusionWhile this explorative study does
   not allow for causal explanations for the lack of explicit instruction,
   its findings provide important insights into classroom practice.
   Implications for teacher education and future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study investigated how socially shared regulation of learning
   (SSRL) emerged during the fluctuation of participation in interaction in
   collaborative learning. Twenty-four student teachers in six small groups
   were video-recorded during collaborative tasks in mathematics.
   Manifestations of SSRL and students' participation were
   micro-analytically coded. Next, the concurrence between manifestations
   of SSRL and the fluctuation of participation was examined and
   illustrative examples were described. The results show that SSRL
   involved more active participation than task-focused interaction overall
   and that SSRL often coincided with increases in participation to a
   higher level than general. The findings suggest that manifestations of
   SSRL involved activated participation during the moments when
   interaction was needed to reciprocally resolve situative challenges and
   to coordinate activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine how assessment is enacted and negotiated in

   collaboratively composed multimodal commercials about various products

   perspectives on learning and assessment, and video data of classroom
   interaction are subjected to detailed analysis. The findings document
   the consequences of decoupling production and assessment practices. The
   analysis show that written texts and multimodal texts have different
   statuses in the project because of how they are assessed and that this
   has consequences for students' participation as learners. In addition,
   the analysis shows how students position themselves differently towards
   resources that are intended to help them in summative assessment
   situations. We discuss issues that teachers may reflect upon when
   planning and executing multimodal composition in schools.},

Abstract = {Recent reforms in science education emphasize having students develop
   and refine core disciplinary ideas through participation in science
   knowledge-building practices. Supporting students' meaningful
   participation in these practices is challenging, in part because our
   understanding of how this kind of participation develops is
   underexplored. This paper characterizes the epistemic dimension of
   classroom scientific practice-the underlying assumptions and criteria
   guiding students' knowledge-building work-in moment-to-moment
   interactions, and how their use of these criteria shifted over time.
   These patterns of change illustrate how, by 8th grade, students were
   more consistently using sophisticated disciplinary forms of epistemic
   criteria than they were in 6th grade. The shifts toward disciplinary
   sophistication were cumulative over time and across content areas,
   suggesting that they reflected a shift in something other than content
   knowledge gains. Yet these cumulative shifts did not occur in a clean,
   predictable progression toward sophistication. This study documents the
   details of these shifts over time and across content areas. By providing
   an empirical account of the evolution of students' knowledgebuilding
   work in practice over time, this study argues for the centrality of
   epistemic learning goals in science education and proposes implications
   for how to measure and support students' meaningful participation in
   scientific practices in contextually valid ways.},

   teachers at the beginning and at the end of their first year in the
   profession and the teaching of experienced teachers with five or more
   years of teaching experience was videotaped, so that longitudinal and
   cross-sectional comparisons were possible. The lessons were analysed by
   applying a coding system on the instruction and by employing a rater
   inventory in order to understand the structure and quality of the
   lessons. Overall, the results indicate high levels of whole class
   teaching with a rather high level of traditional classroom instruction
   both for the novice and the experienced teachers. However, the
   proportions vary depending on the location of teacher education. The
   results provide evidence that the new teaching concepts learned on the
   teacher education programme are not necessarily implemented in the
   classroom and provide possible reasons why this might be the case.},

Abstract = {Students across disciplines struggle with sensemaking when they are
   faced with the need to understand and analyze massive amounts of
   information. This is particularly salient in the disciplines of both
   history and data science. Our approach to helping students build
   expertise with complex information leverages activity theory to think
   about the design of a classroom activity system integrated with the
   design of a collaborative open-source network-analysis software tool
   called Net.Create. Through analysis of network log data as well as video
   data of students' collaborative interactions with Net.Create, we explore
   how our activity system helped students reconcile common contradictions
   that create barriers to dealing with complex datasets in large lecture
   classrooms. Findings show that as students draw on details in a
   historical text to collaboratively construct a larger network, they
   begin to move more readily between small detail and aggregate overview.
   Students at both high and low initial skill levels were able to increase
   the complexity of their historical analyses through their engagement
   with the Net.Create tool and activities. Net.Create transforms the
   limitation of large class sizes in history classrooms into a resource
   for students' collaborative knowledge building, and through
   collaborative data entry it supports the historiographic practices of
   citation and revision and helps students embed local historical actors
   into a larger historical context.},

Title = {Framing Science in a New Context: What Students Take Away From a
   Student-Directed Inquiry Curriculum},
Journal = {SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {97},
Number = {6},
Pages = {801-829},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Student-directed inquiry in science is an important mechanism for
   helping students develop a repertoire of practices that reflects the
   work of real scientists. But few studies consider what students ``take
   away{''} from this type of instruction, i.e., how strategies developed
   in such curricula transfer into other contexts. Our research addresses
   this gap by examining how strategies cultivated in a yearlong chemistry
   curriculum (the originating context) appeared (absent teacher
   intervention) in a new context with new peers. Dependent upon Lobato's
   actor-oriented transfer perspective (2006), this mixed-methods study
   deploys a multilevel analysis of video data collected in six physics
   classrooms (the new context) during a researcher-designed activity.
   Results show that absent teacher directives, two classes partially
   attempted to frame the physics inquiry using strategies cultivated in
   the original context, and one fully framed the new context using these
   strategies. This class's successful use of a specific focusing
   phenomenon (electing student managers) appeared as the key component in
   this full framing. Significantly, we found that a carefully designed
   inquiry curriculum can support students' capacity to (a) organize to
   work collaboratively, (b) communicate to engage all students in the
   inquiry investigation, and (c) conduct scientific work that meets
   disciplinary requirements. (C) 2013Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed

Abstract = {This study critically examines how the geopolitical configuration of
   identities, through the medium of the institutionalized label of
   ``English language learners,{''} can shape and constrain localized
   experiences for learners. An ethnographic video study was conducted in
   the context of a mathematics unit ({''}the transforming recess unit{''})
   wherein learners conducted surveys, summarized data, and voiced the
   changes they hoped to see in the elementary school playground. Findings
   demonstrate both empowering and disempowering ways of mobilizing data
   and graphs, which are intertwined with multi-layered identities.
   Interactions in the classroom were nested in macro-level geopolitical
   configuration of identities that influenced labeled learners' access to
   becoming ``agents of change{''} who could voice their desired changes in
   school practices. Categorical and binary frameworks inscribed in
   mathematics curriculum served as a context for inheritance and
   reproduction of existing categories through student surveys and graphs.
   Implications are discussed toward disrupting and transforming
   taken-for-granted labeling and rigid institutionalized practices through
   which colonial representation of the Other can be co-constructed.},

Title = {Manifestations of Mathematics Within the Power Dynamics in a Pre-K
   Classroom},
Journal = {TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {122},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background/Context: Young children's engagement with mathematics is
   occurring in a context in which school transition and readiness concerns
   that invoke increased institutional rules and disciplinary practices
   involving power dynamics are coming into play. These trends made us
   curious to undertake an in-depth investigation of the different ways
   children and their teachers engage in mathematics in preschool
   classrooms today.
   Purpose/Focus of Study: In our video-ethnography study we explored the
   ways mathematics manifested itself in a Pre-K setting and how
   mathematics functioned in different ways throughout the school day. The
   question guiding our research was: Recognizing the context of current
   transition and readiness concerns in early childhood education, in what
   ways is mathematics manifested in the interactions of teachers and
   children in a Pre-K classroom?
   Setting: The study took place in a childcare center, accredited by the
   National Association for the Education of Young Children, in the United
   States.
   Participants: Participants in this study were four 4- to 5-year-old
   children and their teachers in an ethnically diverse classroom.
   Research Design: The study drew on a video-ethnographic method through
   semester-long observations and video-recordings in a Pre-K classroom.
   The analysis began with (a) labeling manifestations of mathematics in
   the video data through open coding, proceeded to (b) the examination and
   the categorization of the various manifestations of mathematics, was
   followed by (c) the identification of the key scenes which best
   represented each category, and ended with (d) the multimodal analysis of
   the key scenes.
   Findings: This research illustrated that formal mathematics teaching and
   learning contexts included the kinds of disciplinary and bodily control
   practices that have been evident in studies of children at the preschool
   level transitioning into school. The study demonstrated the ways that
   mathematics, with its authoritative and classificatory nature, became a
   disciplinary tool itself during the course of the day. Also evident were
   the ways in which all actors in the classroom drew on mathematics for
   problem-solving in real-life situations within a power/resistance
   dynamic.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: This research raises questions of how
   disciplinary practices might limit children's mathematics learning. The
   finding that mathematics was implicated in the practices of power
   dynamics among teachers and children and among children opens up
   possibilities for teachers to recognize how mathematics is being used
   informally and creatively by children. Teachers can then use this
   knowledge to build on young children's identities as powerful and
   competent mathematicians, using mathematics in problem solving during
   day-to-day interactions.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In spite of a lack of consensus about the nature of scientific models,
   the role of models and modelling are well established in the practice of
   science. Students who participate in developing, validating, deploying,
   and refining models are engaged in authentic scientific practices.
   Modelling instruction (MI) was developed to promote the role of models
   and modelling in introductory university physics classes. MI for
   university physics is founded on the basis of two theoretical
   foundations, modelling theory of science and modelling theory of
   instruction. We claim that the translation of these theories into
   classroom practice supports learning in science. We substantiate this
   claim by first describing how these theories establish complementary
   cycles of content development and student participation. Then we provide
   evidence of these interacting cycles by analysing the development of a
   conceptual model in a MI university physics class using video data. The
   video data we present includes students developing a scientific
   conceptual model first in a small student group and a later in the full
   class. We argue that the integration of the theoretical components
   underlying MI are key supports in providing the opportunity for students
   to develop conceptual models and engage in the practice of doing
   physics.},

   literacy as a situated social practiceour analysis reveals how multiple

   valued resources in the dialogic process of inquiry. More specifically,
   the students engaged in literacy practices that transcended the contexts
   of science and school science to incorporate texts and literacy
   practices from the students' everyday lives as well as practices that
   were confined to a school-only context. On the basis of their talk about

   activity in which students are being asked to engage, my stance on
   ``successful learning environments{''} pulls from both Gutierrez's
   descriptions of what characterizes classrooms as aiming for equity and
   the emphasis on the importance of conceptually oriented goals for
   student learning that is outlined in documents like the Standards.
   Though as a field we are growing in our knowledge of practices that
   support these successful learning environments, this knowledge has not
   yet been reflected in many of the observational tools, rubrics, and
   protocols used to study these environments. In addition, there is a
   growing need to develop empirically grounded ways of attending to the
   extent to which the practices that are being outlined in research
   literature actually contribute to the ``success{''} of these learning
   environments. Purpose:The purpose of this article is to explore one way
   of meeting this growing need by describing the complex work of
   developing a set of classroom observation rubrics (the Equity and Access
   Rubrics for Mathematics Instruction, EAR-MI) designed to support efforts
   in identifying and observing critical features of classrooms
   characterized as having potential for ``success.{''} In developing the
   rubrics, I took as my starting place findings from an analysis that
   compared a set of classrooms that were characterized as demonstrating
   aspects of successful learning environments and a set of classrooms that
   were not characterized as successful. This paper not only describes the
   process of developing the rubrics, but also outlines some of the
   qualitative differences that distinguished more and less effective
   examples of the practices the rubrics are designed to capture. Research
   Design:In designing the rubrics, I engaged in multiple cycles of
   qualitative analyses of video data collected from a large-scale study.
   Specifically, I iteratively designed, tested, and revised the developing
   rubrics while consistently collaborating with, consulting with, and
   receiving feedback from different experts in the field of education.
   Conclusions:Although I fully acknowledge and recognize that there are
   several tensions and limitations of this work, I argue that developing
   rubrics like the EAR-MI is still worthwhile. One reason that I give for
   continuing these types of efforts is that it contributes to the work of
   breaking down forms of practice into components and identifying key
   aspects of specific practices that are critical for supporting student
   learning in ways that make potentially productive routines of action
   visible to and learnable by others, which may ultimately contribute to
   the development of more successful learning environments.
   I also argue that rubrics like the EAR-MI have the potential to support
   researchers in developing stronger evidence of the effectiveness of
   practices that prior research has identified as critical for
   marginalized students and in more accurately and concretely identifying
   and describing learning environments as having potential for ``success.

Abstract = {Learning science outdoors can enhance the understanding of theoretical
   scientific content taught in the classroom. However, learners are rarely
   afforded the opportunity to go outdoors to learn chemistry. This study
   investigates how problem-based learning outdoors can facilitate the
   understanding of basic chemistry in teacher education. A teaching unit
   was designed according to which student teachers at two Norwegian
   universities were asked to examine and identify corroded metals in the
   nearby outdoor environment and propose solutions to avoid this
   corrosion. Video data from this task were collected by using
   chest-mounted cameras for four groups of student teachers (N = 17). A
   thematic analysis of the videos yielded four themes related to the
   student teachers' use of content knowledge and experimental competence.
   Based on these findings, three learning opportunities were deduced for
   how the nearby outdoor environment allows learners to use everyday
   phenomena for learning basic chemistry. First, the availability of
   different corrosion incidents allowed the student teachers to choose and
   solve one of interest to them. Second, the proximity of the outdoor
   location to the classroom enabled the seamless continuity of discussions
   when switching between the learning arenas, and allowed for different
   approaches to solve the task. Third, being asked to conduct analyses
   outside customary laboratory routines led to an unexpected awareness of
   health and safety issues among the student teachers, indicating that
   outdoor chemistry is an overlooked opportunity for teaching these.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify when and how the interactive
   whiteboard (IWB) functioned as a productive tool that impacted student
   learning in mathematics. Using video data, field notes, and interview
   transcripts from I school year in two optimal case study classrooms, we
   were able to examine the unique opportunities afforded by the size of
   the IWB screen, the manipulation of virtual objects onscreen, and
   related communication using gestures. We: (i) established criteria for
   defining ``significant learning moments{''}; (ii) assessed these
   significant learning moments to determine how the interactive whiteboard
   was supporting the learning; and (iii) isolated the use of gesture
   during IWB use to magnify the grain size of our analysis and
   understanding. The data fell into three types of IWB use: productive
   (89\%), reproductive (2\%), and problematic (9\%). The study recommends
   that in order to best support student learning, professional development
   for teachers should emphasize direct and active student use of the IWB
   to engage students in inquiry of mathematics.},

Abstract = {Amy Goods's software review article V-Note: A video analysis tool for
   teacher | researchers stimulated our interest in adopting this software
   to understand social bonding dynamics in a group of 10th-grade science
   students' during a science inquiry project. Three of us employed V-Note
   to analyze two video files for the same lesson in which the student
   group completed an inquiry about the effects of mass on speed using a
   marble and ramp. Subhashni provides her perspective as teacher |
   researcher, James offers an analysis as an independent researcher, and
   Alberto is the classroom researcher who designed a larger project
   investigating the interplay of social bonds with science learning of
   which this study is a part. Alberto also drew upon a more extensive set
   of data sources including social bond diaries completed by students, and
   reflective dialogs with the class. Rebecca interprets the three video
   analyses, as an independent researcher who did not access the video
   data. Our independent analyses and additional data sources produce
   diverse understandings about the impact of shifting social bond status
   on science learning and science inquiry. Outcomes include
   differentiation between social bonds and social roles adopted by
   students during the inquiry. Data analyses also reveal the researchers's
   different ontologies and epistemologies. We also showcase V-Note's
   capabilities, affordances, and constraints for social inquiry.

Abstract = {Video is one of the fastest growing online services offered to
   consumers. The rapid growth of online video consumption brings new
   opportunities for marketing executives and researchers to analyze
   consumer behavior. However, video also introduces new challenges.
   Specifically, analyzing unstructured video data presents formidable
   methodological challenges that limit the use of multimedia data to
   generate marketing insights. To address this challenge, the authors
   propose a novel video feature framework based on machine learning and
   computer vision techniques, which helps marketers predict and understand
   the consumption of online video from a content-based perspective. The
   authors apply this framework to two unique data sets: one provided by
   MasterClass, consisting of 771 online videos and more than 2.6 million
   viewing records from 225,580 consumers, and another from Crash Course,
   consisting of 1,127 videos focusing on more traditional education
   disciplines. The analyses show that the framework proposed in this
   article can be used to accurately predict both individual-level consumer
   behavior and aggregate video popularity in these two very different
   contexts. The authors discuss how their findings and methods can be used
   to advance management and marketing research with unstructured video
   data in other contexts such as video marketing and entertainment
   analytics.},

Abstract = {The principle that emergent writing is supported by talk, and that an
   appropriate pedagogy for writing should include planned opportunities
   for talk is well researched and well understood. However, the process by
   which talk becomes text is less clear. The term `oral rehearsal' is now
   commonplace in English classrooms and curriculum policy documents, yet
   as a concept it is not well theorised. Indeed, there is relatively
   little reference to the concept of oral rehearsal in the international
   literature, and what references do exist propose differing
   interpretations of the concept. At its most liberal, the term is used
   loosely as a synonym for talk; more precise definitions frame oral
   rehearsal, for example, as a strategy for reducing cognitive load during
   writing; for post-hoc reviewing of text; for helping writers to `hear'
   their own writing; or for practising sentences aloud as a preliminary to
   writing them down. Drawing on a systematic review of the literature and
   video data from an empirical study, the paper will offer a theoretical
   conceptualisation of oral rehearsal, drawing on existing understanding
   of writing processes and will illustrate the ways in which young writers
   use oral rehearsal before and during writing.},

   video analysis of program adherence, and a measure of cost. Analysis
   involved nonparametric tests and thematic analysis of interview and
   video data. Cost was calculated for the group and per survivor.
   Survivors achieved significant gains in knowledge/skills, made further
   disclosures, and were positive about their program experience. No gains
   were identified in the control group. Costs were small. Future studies
   need to explore survivor experience of programs delivered in classrooms.},

Abstract = {There is a lack of instruments for measuring teaching behavior in
   academic learning. This article introduces an observation sheet (BEO-LV)
   that allows for a descriptive measurement of teacher-centered and
   student-centered teaching. To facilitate teachers' acceptance of data
   collection, observations may also be used to support professional
   development activities. Here we present two studies examining the
   psychometric properties of the BEO-LV: (1) The interrater agreement and
   interrater reliability in an observation-based study were found to be
   satisfactory. (2) The interrater agreement and internal validity in a
   video study were found to be satisfactory for observers with advanced
   didactic knowledge. The results indicate that the BEO-LV is suitable for
   measuring teaching behavior. To achieve good psychometric results, the
   observer must have detailed insight into the operationalized definitions
   of the items.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of teachers' biology-specific dimensions

   comprised 39 German secondary school teachers whose lessons on the topic
   neurobiology were videotaped twice. Teachers' instruction was coded with
   regard to cognitive activation using a rating manual. Multilevel path
   analysis results showed a positive significant effect of cognitive
   activation on students' learning and an indirect effect of teachers' PCK
   on students' learning mediated through cognitive activation. These
   findings highlight the importance of PCK in preservice biology teachers'
   education. Items of the rating manual may be used to provide exemplars

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this article, we present a methodology for measuring scaffolding in
   small group classroom settings. We have investigated scaffolding by
   analysing teacher-student-interactions and developed an instrument to
   code student level of attainment and teacher strength of intervention as
   the relevant student and teacher variables. For the construction of
   interaction patterns the coded variables were related to each other. In
   order to assess the resulting interaction patterns for scaffolding
   quality, we devised rules based on the contingent shift principle. The
   analyses show that our methodology is reliable and valid, and that it is
   effective for discerning contingent from non-contingent interaction
   patterns. Furthermore, our fine-grained methodology allows us to
   identify and locate crucial points in the teacher's supporting behaviour
   that make for contingent or non-contingent scaffolding. Implications for
   the assessment of instructional quality as well as for teacher education
   and professionalism are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This paper is about implementing a translanguaging approach to teach
   reading skills in English with simultaneous bilinguals who speak
   substantial amounts of Malay and Chinese at home. This new pedagogical
   approach was tried out with 2nd graders in 3 schools in Singapore:
   instead of the typical immersion approach to teaching reading skills in
   English, emergent simultaneous biliterates were offered translanguaging
   opportunities. The goal of this `proof of concept' was to teach
   vocabulary, grammar and comprehension in English through systematic and
   judicious use of Chinese and Malay. 14 h of video data from 3 schools
   was coded for interactional patterns in which the teacher and students
   translanguaged. The focus of this paper is on qualitatively analyzing
   the teacher's pedagogical strategies and individual students' responses.
   Translanguaging stimulated metalinguistic awareness which helped
   individual students notice nuances in punctuation, orthography,
   grammatical structures and meaning that had previously gone unnoticed.
   Finally this study revealed that while teaching simultaneous
   bilinguals/biliterates it is important for teacher training to highlight
   moments when translanguaging might not be required for learning the
   target language.},

Abstract = {The on-the-job collaborative discourse of teachers is said to offer
   promising insights into the implicit processes of teacher learning and
   socialisation (Lefstein et al. 2020). Building on existing theory and
   research, this article examines diagnostic frame disputes in teachers'
   discussions that involve the negotiation of contradictions between
   external expectations and teachers' own frames of reference. This
   phenomenon is illustrated using two purposively-sampled vignettes, drawn
   from video data generated in two Malaysian secondary schools in 2019. In
   both vignettes, teachers work to reconcile the discrepancies between how
   student learning problems are framed by external accountability
   measures, as well as how the teachers interpret those problems locally,
   leading to disputes about how to frame those problems. The analysis
   presents an empirical illustration of how teachers negotiate situated
   meaning, shedding light on how they interpret and respond to
   accountability pressures on their practice. Implications for policy and
   practice are discussed.},

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Information literacy is an essential skill for biologists; however, most
   biology curricula do not intentionally integrate information literacy
   into classroom and laboratory exercises. There is evidence that
   developing information literacy skills in undergraduates improves their
   research skills, writing, and GPAs. Our objective was to integrate
   information literacy skills into a first semester introductory biology
   laboratory with a multi-week, inquiry-based module that leverages
   primary literature. Here we describe the module, which challenges
   students to develop and test a hypothesis related to parental care
   behaviour in birds. Students form hypotheses based on literature
   searching done during librarian-led information literacy sessions,
   produce an annotated bibliography, collect and analyse video data of
   barn swallows feeding their offspring, and present their findings.
   Analysis of students' annotated bibliographies indicates that 83\% of
   the referenced papers were appropriate for developing their specific
   hypotheses. The key elements of a successful information literacy
   training plan include faculty-librarian collaboration, multiple
   classroom or laboratory sessions that introduce or utilize information
   literacy, and relevance of the information literacy training to an
   assignment. By introducing information literacy early inbiology
   curricula, departments can develop tiered information literacy plans
   that incorporate opportunities for students to use and refine these
   skills throughout their studies.},

Title = {Show, Don't Tell: Multimodal Story Feedback in a K-1 Play-Based Writing
   Unit},
Journal = {TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {123},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: With standardization ever squeezing creative curricula in
   K-1 classrooms, creating time for a play-based multimodal writing
   curriculum that leverages children's strengths as storytellers is
   revolutionary. Due in part to accountability policy pressures,
   print-based writing and verbocentric writing feedback are still often
   privileged in school curricula. And yet, children are natural whole-body
   storytellers who will be asked to write and present ideas in all sorts
   of forms. In order to leverage children's storytelling strengths, we
   need to teach writing through multiple modes: This means expanding both
   writing instruction and the types of feedback offered to writers in
   primary classrooms.
   Research Questions: This study examines two questions: How is feedback
   being given, and what impact does it have on children's storytelling?
   How is play/storying being sanctioned?
   Setting \& Participants: The study took place in a K-1 classroom in an
   inquiry-based, project-based school in the U.S. Midwest during a
   month-long storytelling workshop unit. Participants included two
   co-teachers and 46 children aged 5 to 7.
   Research Design: This qualitative study used ethnographic methods and
   participant observation.
   Data Collection \& Analysis: Video data were collected during workshop
   each day for one month, including minilessons, writing time, and share
   time, which is the focus of this article. Discourse analysis and a
   multimodality theoretical lens were used to analyze how children gave
   one another feedback on their stories through embodied demonstration,
   gesture, acting, out, or copying one another's storytelling devices.
   Findings: Findings indicate that children's acting/embodiment,
   humor/parody, and copying all worked as effective forms of multimodal
   feedback, which ultimately functioned as teaching for developing peers'
   storytelling strategies and skills. However, teachers inadvertently
   privileged language alone via narration, or language with demonstration
   in feedback sessions.
   Conclusions: Teacher/researcher collaborations should explore ways to
   reimagine forms of writer's feedback that include and account for
   demonstration, copying, and impromptu performance and that, ultimately,
   open up the definition of what counts as writing at school. Um, you
   should work on making your story, like, real. Because, um, you're going
   all over the place {[}wiggles entire body to illustrate]-Allen, age 6},

Title = {``Why aren't there enough of our stories to read?{''}: Teaching
   autoethnographies for radical healing},
Journal = {ENGLISH TEACHING-PRACTICE AND CRITIQUE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {213-227},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to draw on the analysis of instruction and
   student work in an English Language Arts classroom to discuss how
   teachers may support dispossessed students' journeys toward radical
   healing (Ginwright, 2010) by using critically caring pedagogies -
   pedagogies grounded in teachers' deep understanding of the systemic
   inequalities faced by their students and a strong commitment to
   contributing to social justice. Radical healing involves naming and
   redefining individual experiences of oppression as collective struggle
   to express desire and hope (Winn, 2012; 2013; Tuck, 2009).
   Design/methodology/approach The data used for this paper included video
   data from a two-week writing unit and fieldnotes from preceding lessons,
   classroom documents and handouts and final work from students. Data were
   analyzed through a process of open and focused coding (Coffey and
   Atkinson 1996; Miles and Huberman, 1994).
   Findings Three major practices emerged from the analysis of instruction:
   affirming student experience, connecting individual and community
   struggles and using writing as a space for expressing desire and hope.
   Student work showed how students used their writing to engage in the
   kind of analysis that autoethnographies encourage - reflection on
   individual lives as collective experiences and the expression of hope -
   which the author aligns with the goals of radical healing. Students
   wrote about enduring difficult life circumstances. They also found
   connections between their experiences and the lives of their peers and
   communities. Finally, they used their writing to express desire and
   hope.
   Originality/value The teacher's pedagogy provides an illustration of
   teaching critically caring literacies (Camangian, 2010) that may lead to
   radical healing (Ginwright, 2010) - a pedagogy that seeks justice and
   encourages resilience, particularly for youth who have experienced great
   injustices. This kind of pedagogy requires not only the willingness to
   feel critical hope (Duncan-Andrade, 2009) with students but also a
   commitment to challenging disciplinary canons by allowing students'
   lives to enter the classroom. In her classroom, the teacher created a
   space for her students to reflect on their lives and experience radical
   healing by encouraging them to contextualize their experiences within
   socio-historical processes and social, economic and political structures
   that were designed to create and sustain inequity. The autoethnography
   unit provided an opportunity for students to evaluate their own
   histories, come to terms with the past and begin to express desire and
   imagine hopeful futures (Tuck, 2009; Winn, 2012; 2013).},

Title = {Behavioral engagement in classroom - An analysis of the generalizability

Abstract = {This student-centered video study examines the generalizability and
   reliability of video observations of behavioral engagement of students,
   taking into account the active work phases (partner work, group work,
   plenary) of a third year primary school class (N = 20 students). We used
   an adapted version of the Munich Attention Inventory (Helmke \& Renkl,
   1992) to assess the behavioral engagement of all learners during the
   active work phases in one-second intervals by four independent raters.
   In educational psychology, video studies are often used to describe and
   analyze classroom processes - although they are considered as being very
   resource-intensive and costly. Therefore, in order to enable efficient
   and economical design planning of studies this study investigates up to
   how many seconds the behavioral engagement of students can be reliably
   observed. In line with our expectations, the results of the G-Study show
   that individual learners variance explanation was 18.85\% across all
   work phases. The time in seconds (2.67\%) explains only a marginal part
   of the variance. There remains a large proportion of unexplained
   residual variance (78.48\%). The reliability coefficient with f = .99 is
   very good due to common standards. The decision study (D-Study) shows
   that results are reliable even when observing just 30 seconds (f = .87).
   The results indicate that student-centered video analyses offer a
   valuable way to capture the behavioral engagement of all students, in
   that information on all learners is available throughout the entire
   lesson. The results also contribute to an economic design of
   student-centered video studies on behavioral engagement.},

Title = {Classroom-Based Research Projects for Computing Teachers: Facilitating
   Professional Learning},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The introduction of Computing to the national curriculum in England has
   led to a situation where in-service teachers need to develop subject
   knowledge and pedagogical expertise in computer science, which presents
   a significant challenge. Professional learning opportunities can support
   this; these may be most effective when situated in the teachers' own
   working practices. This article describes a project to support Computing
   teachers in developing pedagogical skills by carrying out
   classroom-based research in their schools. A group of 22 primary (Grades
   K-5) and secondary (Grades 6-10) teachers from schools across England
   planned, designed, and implemented research projects either individually
   or in small groups, supported by a team of university colleagues. Inter
   and intra group progress was shared online and face-to-face within a
   distributed community of inquiry. Data collection included surveys,
   video data, and the projects completed by the teachers. The findings
   from the project are analysed using Clarke and Hollingsworth's
   Interconnected Model of Teacher Professional Growth (IMTPG), which
   enables an identification and exploration of teacher change. Results of
   the analysis demonstrate that the approach can foster ``growth
   networks{''}-the construct used within IMTPG to indicate teacher change
   which is likely to be sustained and fundamental to teachers'
   understanding. The individual nature of this change indicates that the
   approach supports personal change related to each teacher's specific
   situation. Although there is a huge literature on action research as
   part of teacher professional learning, we believe this to be the first
   time this has been carried out in the context of computer science
   education. We conclude by critically reflecting on the lessons that we
   have learned in leading this project.},

Abstract = {Carefully scaffolded dynamic visualizations have potential to promote
   science learning for all students, including English language learners
   (ELLs) who are often underserved in mainstream science classrooms, but
   little is known about how to design effective scaffolding to support
   such diverse students' learning with dynamic visualizations. This study
   investigated how two forms of scaffolding embedded in dynamic
   visualizations, expert guidance and generating guidance, can foster
   ELLs' and non-ELLs' understanding of unobservable scientific phenomena.
   While interacting with dynamic visualizations, students in the expert
   guidance condition were provided with scientifically accurate
   explanations to interpret visual representations, whereas students in
   the generating guidance condition were prompted to generate their own
   explanations using visual representations. The results show the
   significant advantage of generating guidance over expert guidance for
   both ELLs and non-ELLs, although students in the generating guidance
   condition did not receive feedback on their generated artifacts.
   Analyses of video data and log data from 40 pairs revealed that each
   form of scaffolding affected the quantity and quality of linguistically
   diverse students' conversations. The results show that generating
   guidance enabled students, particularly ELLs, to engage in
   discourse-rich practices to evaluate various sources of evidence from
   the visualization and compare the evidence to their alternative ideas to
   develop a coherent understanding of the target concepts. This study
   shows the unique benefits of generating guidance as an effective
   strategy to support linguistically diverse students' science learning
   with dynamic visualizations.},

Title = {Teacher questions and student responses in case-based learning: outcomes
   of a video study in medical education},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Background: Case-based learning (CBL) is a highly interactive
   instructional format widely used in medical education. One goal of CBL
   is to integrate basic biomedical knowledge and its application to
   concrete patient cases and their clinical management. In this context,
   we focus the role of teacher questions as triggers for reproductive vs.
   elaborative student responses. Specifically, our research questions
   concern the kinds of questions posed by clinical teachers, the kinds of
   responses given by students, the prediction of student responses based
   upon teacher questions, and the differences between the two medical
   disciplines in focus of our study, internal medicine and surgery.
   Methods: We analyse 19 videotaped seminars (nine internal medicine, ten
   surgery) taught by clinicians and attended by advanced medical students.
   Multiple raters performed a low-inference rating process using a
   theory-based categorical scheme with satisfactory
   interrater-reliability.
   Results: We found that medical teachers mostly posed initial (instead of
   follow-up) questions and that their questions were more often closed
   (instead of open). Also, more reasoning (than reproductive) questions
   were posed. A high rate of student non-response was observed while
   elaborative and reproductive student responses had a similar prevalence.
   In the prediction context, follow-up reasoning questions were associated
   with low non-response and many elaborative answers. In contrast, the
   highest student non-response rate followed open reproduction questions
   and initial reasoning questions. Most reproductive statements by
   students were made following closed reproduction questions.
   Conclusions: These results deepen our understanding of interactive,
   questions-driven medical teaching and provide an empirical basis for
   clinical teachers to use questions in didactically fruitful ways.},

Title = {Visual and Statistical Methods to Calculate Intercoder Reliability for
   Time-Resolved Observational Research},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Month = {APR 9},
Abstract = {While calculating intercoder reliability (ICR) is straightforward for
   text-based data, such as for interview transcript excerpts, determining
   ICR for naturalistic observational video data is much more complex. To
   date, there have been few methods proposed in literature that are robust
   enough to handle complexities such as the occurrence of simultaneous
   event complexity and partial agreement by the raters. This is especially
   important with the emergence of high-resolution video data, which
   collects nearly continuous or continuous observational data in
   naturalistic settings. In this paper, we present three approaches to
   calculating ICR. First, we present the technical approach to clean and
   compare two coders' results such that traditional metrics of ICR (e.g.,
   Cohen's kappa, Krippendorff's alpha, Scott's pi) can be calculated,
   methods previously unarticulated in literature. However, these
   calculations are intensive, requiring significant data manipulation. As
   an alternative, this paper also proposes two novel methods to calculate
   ICR by algorithmically comparing visual representations of each coders'
   results. To demonstrate efficacy of the approaches, we employ all three
   methods on data from two separate ongoing research contexts using
   observational data. We find that the visual methods perform as well as
   the traditional measures of ICR and offer significant reduction in the
   work required to calculate ICR, with an added advantage of allowing the
   researcher to set thresholds for acceptable agreement in lag time. These
   methods may transform the consideration of ICR in other studies across
   disciplines that employ observational data.},

Abstract = {This study investigated students' activating positive affective
   experiences in mathematics lessons, their antecedents, their cognitive
   and motivational consequences, as well as their effect on achievement.
   The participants were 682 Grade 8 and 9 students from 37 classes from
   Germany and Switzerland who participated in a video study of lessons on
   the Pythagorean theorem. Control and value beliefs as well as autonomy
   support proved to be relevant predictors of positive affective
   experiences. Moreover, positive affective experiences were associated
   with more cognitive activity during the lessons, which for its part
   predicted achievement in the posttest. In a follow-up test, there was
   also an indirect effect of positive affective experiences on
   achievement, mediated by cognitive activity and expectancy of success.

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyse results from one classroom session within an
   8-week program in which Year 10 students constructed `trash' puppets of
   endangered Australian animals. In making the puppets and using them as
   part of a `theatre in a suitcase' performance at Melbourne Zoo, students
   were expected to integrate both scientific and artistic goals to
   demonstrate knowledge of specific endangered species. In this process,
   students needed to learn how their more immediate, everyday positive and
   negative aesthetic responses could be made continuous with a scientific
   aesthetic to produce both a coherent puppet and an advocacy performance.
   Through micro-ethnographic practical epistemology analysis of video data
   of this session, we demonstrate how this mix of everyday and
   subject-specific aesthetic responses, judgements and intentions
   interacted to shape and promote students' learning in science. In
   addressing this multimodal and multi-purpose task, students learnt and

Title = {Socio-emotional interaction in collaborative learning: Combining
   individual emotional experiences and group-level emotion regulation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {102},
Abstract = {This study explores how groups' negative socio-emotional interactions
   and related emotion regulation during a collaborative physics task are
   interconnected with 12-year-old primary school students' (N = 37)
   situated individual emotional experiences. To accomplish this, the study
   relates group-level video data analysis with students' self-reported
   emotional experiences. The results indicate that students' negative
   emotional experiences related to the task prior to collaborative working
   increase the group's emotion regulation during the collaboration and
   that negative group interactions negatively affect students' emotional
   experiences after the task. The study also shows that even though
   group-level regulation is more likely to change the valence of the
   group's interaction from negative to positive, regulation does not
   always succeed in making a difference to the students' overall emotional
   experiences.},

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH},

Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {We analyze how participating in undergraduate research experiences
   (UREs) influenced physics students' trajectories of participation within
   the community of practice of physics researchers. Students in the study
   participated in an elective seminar in which they were paired with
   graduate student and faculty mentors on physics research projects and
   participated in weekly discussions about research. Using video data from
   student interviews and mentor interviews, we characterize two aspects of
   students' engagement in the physics community of practice. First, we
   find variations in their engagement in physics practice, which we
   characterize as physics activities that are connected and purposeful.
   Second, we characterize forms of joint work by the research project's
   form and structure and by patterns of interaction between undergraduates
   and mentors. We argue that forms of joint work influenced students'
   varied senses of how physics activities are connected and purposeful.
   Finally, we use this understanding to suggest how to better scaffold
   UREs.},

Title = {Socio-emotional conflict in collaborative learning-A process-oriented
   case study in a higher education context},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {68},
Pages = {1-14},
Abstract = {This case study explores cognitive, motivational and socio-emotional
   challenges experienced in collaborative learning, how conflict emerges
   and what students' emotional reactions and interpretations are.
   Collaborative work of 22 higher education students was followed during a
   three-month course. All face-to-face group sessions were videotaped (33
   h), and cued retrospective recall interviews (with video stimulus) were
   conducted. The results indicate the differences between the groups with
   respect to the amount and the types of challenges. One case group was
   chosen (one that experienced more and particularly socio-emotional
   challenges) for the in-depth interaction analysis. Their overruling,
   status-centric, undermining and normative interaction created a
   socio-emotional conflict. Students were unable to maintain a
   well-balanced atmosphere, which led them to adopt avoidance-focused
   emotion regulation behaviour and to lower their on-task engagement. (C)

Abstract = {This study investigates how teaching can support students' ability to
   apply rock identification by addressing scientific observation. In the
   context of geology education in Norway, we investigate two cases in
   which different approaches to teaching rock identification are carried
   out. Case A involves traditional teaching activities in one class of
   upper secondary school students, while Case B consists of teaching
   activities focusing on observation in a class of elementary school
   students. The study relies on analysis of video data using headcams from
   classroom activities and fieldwork. A year later, we asked the same
   students to apply rock identification to samples that were new to them.
   Results indicate that the teaching approach influenced the students'
   opportunities for developing an understanding of rock identification.
   The students in case A identified the samples by applying specific names
   of rocks and geological terminology, which led to errors and
   misconnections. Their application of rock identification can be
   characterized as name-dropping. By contrast, the students in case B
   identified rocks by noticing the patterns. They also explained theories
   of rock formation and geological terminology, thus demonstrating
   understanding. We discuss how the findings from case B can be translated
   into a tool for teaching rock identification.},

Abstract = {This study explores remote, non-collocated collaboration via multi-touch
   table (SynergyNet) and video conferencing software (Skype). Twenty-four
   participants (aged 10-11 years) in two locations-primary school
   classrooms located 300 miles apart in the UK-engaged in simultaneous
   collaborative activity to solve a History mystery task. Audio-video data
   recorded in the first minute of the activity were analysed to explore
   the emergence of collaborative working practices both within groups in
   the same location (resizing for shared reading) and between the groups
   communicating via video conferencing software and through the
   ``flick{''} multi-touch gesture (sharing clues between groups). The
   results indicated that most groups focused first on the establishment of
   intra-group collaboration before reaching out to their remotely located
   partners. However, when the second data set was analysed, audio data
   from delayed interviews conducted after the original study, participants
   reported that the discussion between groups supported by the ``flick{''}
   gesture was the most important and memorable feature of the activity.
   The study relates these findings to the existing literature on
   collaborative learning using multi-touch tables and considers how
   teachers are best able to help support the emergence of collaborative
   practices.},

Abstract = {In inquiry-based science education, there have been gradual shifts in
   research interests: the nature of scientific method, the debates on the
   effects of inquiry learning, and, recently, inquiry teaching. However,
   many in-service programs for inquiry teaching have reported inconsistent
   results due to the static view of classroom inquiries and due to the
   partial perspective between individual and collaborative reflections.
   Thus, by means of a theoretical progress model of collaborative
   reflection, this qualitative research aims to investigate reflections of
   four participant teachers before and during a half-year in-service
   teacher program. The model captures the following four interactions for
   each individual teacher and among the teacher cohort: belief to
   practice, practice to belief, stimulation, and reinforcement. The
   audio-video data and their quantification allowed identification of the
   teachers' consistent prior beliefs and practices as a multiplicity of
   inquiry teaching and their interwoven progress during the program. The
   findings are further discussed in terms of the implicit development and
   the richer repertoire.},

Abstract = {Religious diversity plays a central role in theories of religious
   education. However, empirical studies on the role and significance of
   this diversity in teaching religious education still represent a
   desideratum of research. This article addresses this desideratum by
   examining how religious diversity is addressed in Catholic religious
   education within the framework of an explorative video study. To do so,
   it draws on a four-dimensional model that captures religious
   heterogeneity along a positional, a stylistic, a contextual, and a
   biographical dimension. The findings show that the teaching found
   negotiates religious diversity primarily under positional aspects, with
   stylistic aspects playing a secondary role. This finding is discussed in
   conclusion.},

Title = {Gesture in a kindergarten mathematics classroom},
Journal = {EUROPEAN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION RESEARCH JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-66},
Abstract = {Recent studies have advocated that mathematical meaning is mediated by
   gestures. This case study explores the gestures kindergarten children
   produce when learning spatial concepts in a mathematics classroom
   setting. Based on a video study of a mathematical lesson in a
   kindergarten class, we concentrated on the verbal and non-verbal
   behavior of one kindergartner who produced a great amount of gestures
   during instruction. The microgenetic approach was used for the analysis
   of the data. The results showed that the kindergartner used gestures
   throughout the whole instruction. For all the spatial concepts that were
   addressed ('in' and `out', `on' and `under', `up' and `down'), he
   produced mainly deictic gestures referring either to existing or virtual
   objects. The child was found to produce different types of gestures in
   different spatial contexts. Our analysis revealed the occurrence of a
   gesture-speech match and a gesture-speech mismatch. In the latter case,
   the child's gestures were found to complement and enrich his verbal
   utterances. The child's gestures along with his speech acted as semiotic
   means of objectification of specific spatial relations that were rather
   abstract for the child and were not represented adequately by speech.
   Besides the phenomenon of the coordination between oral speech and
   gesture, enacted by the child himself, evidence was found for the
   coordination between the two semiotic systems activated by different
   people, that is, the child under study and the other children or the
   teacher of the class. Furthermore, the teacher's gestures were found to
   influence the child's gestures in different ways. These findings are
   discussed and suggestions for further research on the role of gestures
   in the development of spatial thinking in the early years are drawn.},

Title = {The development, validation, and interpretation of a content coding map

Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Although the content of science lessons has been analyzed from different
   perspectives by developing a set of codes (e.g., K. J. Roth, S. L.
   Druker, H. E. Garnier, M. Lemmens, C. Chen, T. Kawanaka, and R.
   Gallimore, (2006), Teaching science in five countries: results from the
   TIMSS 1999 video study, Washington, DC: National Center for Education
   Statistics), none of the existing coding systems have investigated it
   from a subject-specific and dynamic perspective. Aiming to fill this
   gap, this study develops a content coding map (CCM) to classify the
   content of chemistry lessons (CCL) into 12 types based on their roles
   and values. The CCM was constructed based on semi-structured interviews
   and revised by applying the initial CCM to six videotaped lessons.
   Furthermore, the coding was reviewed by an expert committee to confirm
   the content validity and evaluated by 86 in-service teachers using a
   questionnaire with responses measured on a five-point Likert scale to
   test for face validity. These 12 types of CCL were organized into five
   related groups in the CCM: core knowledge and practices (CKP),
   connections among CKP (C-CKP), expansion of CKP (E-CKP), scaffolding for
   CKP (S-CKP), and meaningless content in relation to CKP (MC-CKP). Each
   group is illustrated and discussed using specific types of CCL. The CCM,
   which provides a new way to explore chemistry classrooms, can be used as
   an analytic tool for chemistry educators to investigate the CCL and can
   serve as a guide for chemistry teachers when designing lessons.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted in a large-scale environmental literacy
   project. In the project, we developed a Learning Progression Framework
   (LPF) for matter and energy in social ecological systems; the LPF
   contains four achievement levels. Based on the LPF, we designed a Plant
   Unit to help Levels 2 and 3 students advance to Level 4 of the LPF. In
   the present study, 12 teachers used the Plant Unit to teach, and their
   students took an LPF-based assessment both before and after the teaching
   intervention. We observed and videotaped 20 lessons from four of those
   participating teachers. In this article, we report on how teachers'
   teaching practice and students' learning practice in classrooms mediate
   the intervention's impact on students' learning outcomes. Regarding
   teaching practice, we focused on how teachers used discourse strategies
   to engage students in meaningful learning. Regarding students' learning
   practice, we studied epistemological frames that the students used to
   guide their thinking. The results show that encouraging students to talk
   about the how and why behind their answers did not always lead to
   students' use of productive frames and positive learning gains. We found
   that one teacher, Ms. S, successfully fostered students' use of
   productive frames by using discourse strategies that target the
   specialized ways of reasoning behind the science content and the
   rationale for scientific investigations. Ms. S' students also achieved a
   learning gain higher than the average learning gain in the intervention.
   These results suggest that discourse strategies aligned with the LPF
   play an important role in learning progression based interventions. (C)

Abstract = {Reporting on a Grade 4 teaching and learning sequence, we highlight
   foundational constructs of measurement and data modelling which are
   fundamental to competence development in both science and mathematics.
   The sequence involved students generating and representing measures of
   their teacher's arm-span, with a focus on the invention and refinement
   of data representations characteristic of STEM epistemic practices. We
   undertook a micro-ethnographic practical epistemology analysis of video
   data of classroom and group discussions and student work, to explore the
   teaching and learning processes driving students' understandings of data
   variation and measures of central tendency. Through this analysis we
   appreciated aesthetic experiences as fundamental for students' growing
   epistemic and conceptual understandings and the teacher's pedagogical
   practices. We draw on the pragmatist aesthetic perspectives of Dewey and
   Peirce to show how students' sign-making shifted from an everyday
   interest in the arm span measuring process to an interest in the
   potentialities of the data set as an exploratory field. We consider this
   a shift from an everyday `art' aesthetic to a `mathematics' disciplinary
   aesthetic. We argue that such an aesthetic perspective, in which feeling
   and meaning are intertwined, provides a powerful way to understand the
   role of affect in learning.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {There is mounting research evidence that contests the metaphysical
   perspective of knowing as mental process detached from the physical
   world. Yet education, especially in its teaching and learning practices,
   continues to treat knowledge as something that is necessarily and solely
   expressed in ideal verbal form. This study is part of a funded project
   that investigates the role of the body in knowing and learning
   mathematics. Based on a 3-week (15 1-h lessons) video study of 1-s grade
   mathematics classroom (N = 24), we identify 4 claims: (a) gestures
   support children's thinking and knowing, (b) gestures co-emerge with
   peers' gestures in interactive situations, (c) gestures cope with the
   abstractness of concepts, and (d) children's bodies exhibit geometrical
   knowledge. We conclude that children think and learn through their
   bodies. Our study suggests to educators that conventional images of
   knowledge as being static and abstract in nature need to be rethought so
   that it not only takes into account verbal and written languages and
   text but also recognizes the necessary ways in which children's
   knowledge is embodied in and expressed through their bodies.},

Abstract = {Offering bilingual learning opportunities in subject matter classrooms
   has been demanded. But control trials show divergent results about their
   efficacy for superior learning gains. Thus, there is a need for
   investigating the conditions under which a learning opportunity can be
   used productively and shows efficacy. In a video study of 13 groups in a
   content- and language-integrated intervention in grade 7, the
   participation and language use were captured and evaluated with respect
   to the statistical relations between individual preconditions and
   learning gains using correlation and regression analyses. The analyses
   show that participation and language use are only little connected with
   the individual preconditions. In contrast, the learning gains correlate
   with the use of Turkish, which encompasses Turkish utterances as well as
   flexible mixing of Turkish and German. Hence, the initiation of
   interconnected and mixed language use is important for the efficacy of
   bilingual learning opportunities.},

Title = {Premising and arguing: The variety in 9-to 10-year-old children taking
   on an equity/equality task in the context of group discussions},
Journal = {LEARNING CULTURE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION},

Abstract = {This study investigates primary school children's practices of premising
   (the handling of task premises) and arguing when confronted with a
   dilemmatic school task as part of a group discussion. As such, the study
   contributes to the field of education and argumentation with new
   insights into how children negotiate validity and relevance in relation
   to the task when asked to argue their stance on an equity/equality
   matter. The data consist of transcripts of 247 min of video recordings
   capturing 13 group discussions (54 children, split into groups of four
   to five, and two teachers) in the German primary school subject
   Sachunterricht. The findings clarify how the children dynamically move
   in and out of the task premises, and at times question them, both
   implicitly and explicitly. The task's openness and ambiguity are
   discussed in relation to the children's arguing and premising. The
   teacher's role as mediator in group discussions is contrasted with other
   forms of classroom discourse. Furthermore, the relevance for researchers
   to consider the social and cultural circumstances of research in schools
   - for example, when interpreting children's utterances - is emphasized.},

Abstract = {Intelligent learning technologies are often applied within the
   educational industries. While these technologies can be used to create
   learning experiences tailored to an individual student, they cannot
   address students' affect accurately and quickly during the learning
   process. This paper focuses on two core research questions. How do
   students regulate affect and what are the processes that affect
   regulation? First, this paper reviews the affect regulation methods and
   processes in an intelligent learning environment based on affective
   transition and affect compensation. This process, along with affect
   analysis, affect regulation, intelligent agents, and an intervention
   strategy can be used to analyze specific affect regulation methods and
   improve the affective regulation system. Seventy-two 7th grade students
   were randomly placed into an experimental condition that used Betty's
   Brain, an intelligent tutoring system (ITS), or a classroom control. A
   lag sequence analysis and a multinomial processing tree analysis of
   video data captured at 25-minute intervals revealed significant
   differences in affect transitions frequencies between the two groups.
   Based on the results of the above analyses and after-class interviews,
   we found that Betty's Brain was able to promote effective
   affect-regulation strategies to students in the domain of forest
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {This study examined how temporal sequences of regulated learning events,
   such as types and processes of regulated learning, emerge during
   different stages of collaborative learning. Earlier research has focused
   on individual learning and not on the captured temporal sequences of
   regulation in collaborative learning. The data were collected during a
   two-month math didactics course taken by teacher education students who
   collaborated in three member groups. Twenty-two hours of video data were
   collected to follow how sequences of regulated learning events, along
   with task execution, emerged within the six groups as their
   collaboration advanced. The data were analyzed using qualitative content
   analysis and lag sequential analysis. The results showed that the groups
   engaged mostly in co-regulated planning and monitoring. Temporal
   analysis showed that collaborative interactions focusing on task
   execution promoted socially shared planning, indicating that task
   execution provided grounding for socially shared planning and regulation
   to occur. The sequential analysis illustrated that metacognitive
   monitoring played a facilitative role in the progress of task execution.

Title = {Developing material-dialogic space in geography learning and teaching:
   Combining a dialogic pedagogy with the use of a microblogging tool},
Journal = {THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Dialogic accounts of learning and teaching are not good at including the
   role of technology. In this exploratory study we use a
   material-discursive theoretical frame, initially derived from Barad, to
   apply the concepts of intra-action and affordance in explaining the
   contribution of the digital to classroom-based group tasks. The
   microblogging tool `Talkwall' is the focus of this study. The aim of
   this study is to explore how dialogic infra-actions may develop in
   material-dialogic space, demonstrating how various affordances are
   enacted in response to task demands and consequent dialogue. This paper
   focuses on data from one geography lesson involving 29 students. It
   reports findings from a detailed micro analysis of infra-action of video
   data and lesson transcripts, comprising six Talkwall episodes. Through
   this analysis the concept of affordance is critiqued and we illustrate
   the infra-action possibilities that may facilitate the creative
   co-construction of ideas in the material-dialogic space created by the
   use of Talkwall. The significance of this paper lies in offering and
   illustrating a new approach to analysing learning and teaching where
   technology plays an important role.},

   approaches for teachers to leverage pupils' making in science education},
Journal = {LEARNING CULTURE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {This article addresses the opportunities and challenges of turning a
   science, technology, engi-neering, and mathematics (STEM) classroom into
   a makerspace for hands-on experimentation with digital tools and
   materials in science education. In this qualitative case study, over a
   period of 16 weeks, video data were collected during making activities
   in an advanced placement science course with 19 pupils aged 12-16 years,
   and interviews were conducted. We combined thematic and interaction
   analyses of empirical data and identified three themes: 1) engagement
   and spontaneous concepts, 2) programming and making physical objects,
   and 3) subject integration. Our conceptual framework for the analyses
   integrated two features of the Vygotskian sociocul-tural theory of
   learning: concept development as a dialectical process of scientific and
   everyday concepts and the ``tool and symbol{''} duality. Our findings
   show that both top-down and bottom-up approaches to integrating school
   subjects into a makerspace were effective but underused. We illustrate
   this by mapping pupils' shared understanding in a sociotechnical space,
   visualized as a process of ``rising to the concrete{''}, which may
   require teacher's scaffolding at different levels of abstraction and use
   of instructional materials in different modalities.},

Abstract = {Offering bilingual learning opportunities in subject matter classrooms
   has been demanded. But control trials show divergent results about their
   efficacy for superior learning gains. Thus, there is a need for
   investigating the conditions under which a learning opportunity can be
   used productively and shows efficacy. In a video study of 13 groups in a
   content- and language-integrated intervention in grade 7, the
   participation and language use were captured and evaluated with respect
   to the statistical relations between individual preconditions and
   learning gains using correlation and regression analyses. The analyses
   show that participation and language use are only little connected with
   the individual preconditions. In contrast, the learning gains correlate
   with the use of Turkish, which encompasses Turkish utterances as well as
   flexible mixing of Turkish and German. Hence, the initiation of
   interconnected and mixed language use is important for the efficacy of
   bilingual learning opportunities.},

   language. We reconstruct extracts of their task solving process in the
   context of a functional-pragmatic discourse analysis. The excerpts of
   the partner work presented in the text show approaches of
   multidimensional reflection processes in working with the text, during
   which it comes to a functional use of both languages. The relevance of
   our reconstruction of student-student interaction during task solving
   will become evident through the embedment of the results in the

Title = {Kindergarten students' mathematics knowledge at work: the mathematics
   for programming robot toys},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL THINKING AND LEARNING},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 SEP 30},
Abstract = {ABSRACT The purpose of this study was to explore how kindergarten
   students (aged 5-6 years) engaged with mathematics as they learned
   programming with robot coding toys. We video-recorded 16 teaching
   sessions of kindergarten students' (N = 36) mathematical and programming
   activities. Students worked in small groups (4-5 students) with robot
   coding toys on the floor in their classrooms, solving tasks that
   involved programming these toys to move to various locations on a grid.
   Drawing on a semiotic mediation perspective, we analyzed video data to
   identify the mathematics concepts and skills students demonstrated and
   the overlapping mathematics-programming knowledge exhibited by the
   students during these programming tasks. We found that kindergarten
   children used spatial, measurement, and number knowledge, and the design
   of the tasks, affordances of the robots, and types of programming
   knowledge influenced how the students engaged with mathematics. The
   paper concludes with a discussion about the intersections of mathematics
   and programming knowledge in early childhood, and how programming robot
   toys elicited opportunities for students to engage with mathematics in
   dynamic and interconnected ways, thus creating an entry point to
   reassert mathematics beyond the traditional school content and
   curriculum.},

Abstract = {This study examined the impact of video-based conversational interaction
   on the longitudinal development (one academic semester) of second
   language production by college-level Japanese
   English-as-a-foreign-language learners. Students in the experimental
   group engaged in weekly dyadic conversation exchanges with native
   speakers in the United States via telecommunication tools. The native
   speaker interlocutors were trained to provide interactional feedback
   (recasts) when the nonnative speakers' utterances hindered successful
   understanding (i. e., negotiation for comprehensibility). The students
   in the comparison group received regular foreign language instruction
   without any interaction with native speakers. The coded video data
   showed that the experimental students worked on improving all linguistic
   domains of language, likely in response to their native speaker
   interlocutors' interactional feedback (recasts, negotiation) during the
   treatment. The pretest-posttest data of the students' spontaneous
   production showed that they made significant gains in the dimensions of
   comprehensibility, fluency, and lexicogrammar but not in those of
   accentedness and pronunciation.},

Journal = {QUALITATIVE RESEARCH},

Abstract = {This article explores a `hybridized approach' to multimodal research
   drawing on video data of classroom communication involving children
   diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The focus is a short video of
   `Luke', aged six, who at snack time declines to request an available
   food item (carrot, tomato or apple) with the available Picture Exchange
   Communication System (PECS); instead deploying embodied, idiosyncratic
   communication including gaze, vocalisation and object manipulation to
   request raisins. The article explores the potential of a hybridized
   approach for understanding Luke's communicative competencies which draws
   upon the theoretical perspectives of Ethnography of Communication,
   Conversation Analysis and Multimodal (Inter)Action Analysis; and uses
   two forms of multimodal transcription (the multimodal matrix and
   annotated video stills). It is argued that each tradition brings
   distinct affordances to our understanding of this short interaction and
   that together they can permit inferences which would not have been
   possible working with one approach alone.},

Title = {Primary students' learning about citizenship through data science},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 2},
Abstract = {Much of the mathematics that children experience in school neglect the
   skills increasingly needed for citizenship, particularly the power of
   complex data to investigate and make sense of the world. We draw on the
   relatively new field of data science as a multi-disciplinary approach to
   investigate problems through analysis of massive, non-standard,
   incongruous and/or messy data. Our exploratory qualitative study had as
   its research question: What can children learn about citizenship when
   they engage with data science? The case study in this paper illustrated
   ways that children's learning about citizenship were enriched through an
   age-appropriate data science investigation. The study analysed classroom
   video from a Year 4 classroom (aged 9-10) over six lessons that
   integrated curricula in digital technologies, health, and mathematics.
   In these lessons, the children generated and analysed non-standard data
   and debated social, well-being and privacy issues as they considered
   their activities in cyberspace. The video data were analysed using a
   framework based on critical citizenship education literature that
   examined dimensions of power, collective engagement, individual
   responsibility and action. Three key findings emerged. First, the case
   study highlighted skills in citizenship education developed through data
   science, positioning children as agents and advocates. Second, the study
   showed how a complex data investigation in citizenship education was
   achievable with primary children through meaningful curriculum
   integration. This is important given that problems that citizens address
   are typically interdisciplinary. Finally, the findings revealed a gap
   between data science skills and those developed in the mathematics
   curriculum, and recommend ways that the maths curriculum could be
   updated.},

Abstract = {In this article, I analyze teachers' use of students' everyday knowledge
   and experiences as resources for learning in educational dialogues. By
   analyzing video data of teachers' attempts to contextualize instruction
   in naturalistic settings in a lower secondary school, I examine how
   teachers use such resources to support and guide student learning. By
   employing a situated approach to learning, I provide a turn-by-turn
   analysis of how teachers use students' everyday knowledge as resources
   to socially construct knowledge when working with academic subject
   matter. The concepts of intercontextuality and positioning function as
   analytical tools that enable an analysis of the relationships between
   the use of everyday experiences and the social organization of
   participation during teachers' instructional work. The findings show
   that attempts at contextualizing instruction were identified in many of
   the lessons. The findings also document that teachers face both
   challenges and opportunities when contextualizing instruction. A
   turn-by-turn analysis shows that the function of everyday experiences in
   educational dialogues depends on how such resources are mobilized, how
   they are brought into the conversations, as well as the roles assigned
   to students in the dialogues. In the article, issues contributing to the
   productive use of everyday resources in educational dialogues are
   displayed and discussed.},

Title = {Learning to listen and listening to learn: one student's experience of

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {333-348},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The dialogic nature of small group collaborative learning requires
   verbal contributions from students to progress individual and group
   learning. Speaking can become privileged over listening as a
   collaborative act, and an imbalance in these values can become embedded
   in the classroom culture to the degree that the core value of listening
   can be invisible to students new to the learning contexts. The focus of
   this paper is a single case study of the experience of an international
   Asian-background student (Korean), learning in a Western (Australian)
   problem-based learning (PBL) physiotherapy context. Video data and
   interviews highlight his difficulty with learning to listen and
   listening to learn, and his privileging of speaking over listening. We
   question whether failure to signal the importance of listening is the
   result of the current shift in emphasis to learning through speaking,
   leading to a subsequent loss of attention to the role of listening in
   collaborative learning. Further, we question the cultural inclusivity of
   the PBL educational paradigm and recommend specific tutor training on
   scaffolding students' listening skills in this dialogic learning
   context.},

Abstract = {Young children on the autism spectrum have minimal social interaction
   with their peers in inclusive preschool settings, thus limiting
   opportunities to build social relationships. Research indicates that
   explicitly training peers how to interact with classmates with autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD) can increase the likelihood of peer-directed
   behavior; however, less is known about other strategies that can be used
   to support the peer-related social interactions of children with ASD and
   how those strategies may be used in conjunction with trained peers.
   Video data were analyzed from 23 classrooms using the Learning
   Experiences and Alternative Program for Preschoolers and Their Parents
   model (an inclusive preschool program that emphasizes peer training and
   peer support) to provide a snapshot of environmental features and the
   role of implementation fidelity that may enhance or inhibit the social
   interaction of 52 children with ASD. Findings indicate that social
   interaction is most likely to occur when an adult is not present, during
   small group activities, pretend play, and large motor activities.
   Implications for practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article addresses how methodological approaches relying on video
   can be included in literacy research to capture changing literacies. In
   addition to arguing why literacy is best studied in context, we provide
   empirical examples of how small, head-mounted video cameras have been
   used in two different research projects that share a common aim:
   understanding the complex ways in which literacy is a part of school
   practices. The complexity of literacy practices taking place in
   classrooms, where students draw on a number of texts for a variety of
   purposes and different literacy discourses co-exist in the same setting,
   poses a serious challenge for those who wish to study literacy in
   educational settings. The methodology presented in this article is our
   attempt to meet this challenge. Our approach relies on using video
   equipment in innovative ways to capture multiple perspectives, involving
   research participants in the data collection process and the early
   stages of analysis, and analysing video data with digital coding
   software. These methods are combined to obtain a more systematic and
   detailed insight into the contexts in which literacy takes place.},

Abstract = {Show-and-Tell activity provides emergent bilingual (EB) children with an
   opportunity to engage oral language skills to support their developing
   bi/literacy. In dual language bilingual education (DLBE) preschool
   programs, teachers utilize translanguaging practices to facilitate
   communication, scaffold learning, and encourage participation. Using a
   sustainable translanguaging lens, we explore English- and
   Spanish-language model teachers' pedagogical choices in Show-and-Tell in
   support of children's Show-and-Tell purposes and practices. Video data
   were analyzed for discourse- and content-related codes to examine
   teachers' discursive and translanguaging choices and presenters'
   languaging practices during Show-and-Tell. Qualitative analyses revealed
   that teachers' translanguaging choices vary in response to the language
   context (i.e. teacher's designated language of instruction and the
   target language of the Show-and-Tell) and to children's languaging
   practices (i.e. choice of language, amount of unprompted talk, purpose
   of presentation, degree of peer involvement). Given the vulnerable
   status of Spanish as the minoritized language in an English-majority
   culture, teachers sustained the use and modeling of Spanish in Spanish
   Show-and-Tell while integrating Spanish as a supportive resource in
   English Show-and-Tell. Findings suggest implications for how teachers
   can protect minoritized languages within DLBE preschool programs while
   valuing children's authentic translanguaging practices and building on
   children's understanding language functions and forms in each language.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the ways early childhood teachers co-regulate
   children's activities, behaviour and emotions in various
   socio-emotionally challenging situations and how teachers identify the
   co-regulation strategies they use in these situations. The data consist
   of 31 video episodes of different socio-emotionally challenging
   situations among children aged 2-5 years, in day-care activities. The
   data also include stimulated recall interviews conducted with the
   teachers (N=8). Based on the video episodes, the video data are analysed
   by exploring co-regulation strategies that the teachers use in
   challenging situations. Interview data are analysed by comparing
   teachers' descriptions of co-regulation strategy use to the
   co-regulation categories formed in the video analysis. The results of
   this study show that teachers engage in co-regulation during day-care
   activities. They use various strategies and combine these when they
   encounter challenges, particularly favouring activity-related strategies
   instead of emotion-related strategies. Furthermore, the results indicate
   that the teachers are, to some extent, aware of their co regulative
   strategy use, but they could benefit from training that would increase
   their awareness of different strategies that potentially support
   children's self-regulation in socio-emotionally challenging early
   childhood contexts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Bringing Joy to School: Engaging K-16 Learners Through Maker Literacies
   and Playshops},
Journal = {TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {123},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: For too many youths, school has become a place for students
   to withstand and kill time until they can leave and learn about things
   that matter to them. Instead, schools should be inviting and exciting
   places to learn but also nurturing spaces where all students feel they
   belong. Drawing upon expanded definition of literacies that include play
   and making, this study examines how the maker literacies-media
   production where multimodal, digital, and artifact-based literacies
   converge-creates opportunities for youth to critically engage their
   favorite toys and media in school. While the preponderance of research
   on media literacy has focused on critical consumption of multimedia,
   research on play-based literacies has focused largely on early childhood
   (K-2) spaces. This article examines student engagement in the
   intersection of critical media production and play-based literacies for
   older youth, specifically play, toymaking, and filmmaking in classroom
   makerspaces.
   Purpose: The goal of the ongoing Literacy Playshop studies is to explore
   the meaning-making and participation that youth experience through
   production-oriented maker literacies (e.g., toy(re)making, filmmaking)
   in P-12 settings. Maker literacies enable students to critically respond
   to pervasive stereotypes in popular media by producing their own films
   by ``toyhacking{''} or remaking physical features of toys that also
   enable revised character identities and alternative storylines. The
   research within this article aimed to understand how preservice and
   in-service teachers approach play-based media production as a
   participatory literacy for students in classroom makerspaces.
   Research Design: Using mediated discourse analysis, toy remaking and
   filmmaking is examined to unpack the tangles of meanings, bodies, and
   toys in the action texts and imaginary contexts of play. Researchers
   looked across three sites, including a third-grade classroom, a literacy
   methods course for preservice elementary teachers, and a methods course
   for secondary English/Language Arts preservice teachers, all of which
   implemented a curricular framework for play-based makerspaces. Using
   ethnographic methods, multimodal video analysis, and mediated discourse
   analysis, researchers compared critical media literacy strategies in
   these three sites. Data sources included: video data of students'
   toyhacking, hacked toys, student-created films centering toys,
   researcher fieldnotes, written reflections of preservice teachers, and
   interviews with the in-service teacher.
   Findings: Findings suggest student engagement was significantly
   increased through the collaborative digital film process, which often
   gave preservice and inservice teachers the chance to expand their
   conception of literacy. Teaching children and preservice teachers to
   engage in play-based literacies allowed participants to more actively
   participate in their own education, assisting them in creating their own
   media, responding critically, productively, and multimodally to a world
   filled with popular animated films, television, video games, and digital
   media texts.
   Conclusions: Overall, findings align with calls to reconceptualize and
   update literacy curricula across K-12 and teacher education programs to
   center student meaning-making, agency, and critical response. More
   research is needed to understand the intersections of participatory
   literacies, mass media, critical literacy, and social justice.},

Abstract = {Integrating concepts and techniques from ethnomethodology and
   sociomaterialism, this article investigates the observable material
   processes involving human action and place-based contexts of language
   use enabled by locative media. The focal pedagogical intervention
   utilized mobile augmented reality (AR) activities, the development of
   which was inspired by research on learning `in the wild.' Applying the
   principle of reverse engineering, we introduce a pedagogical approach
   termed `rewilding' for its emphasis on designing supportive conditions
   for goal-directed interaction outside of classrooms. Three instances of
   AR materials use are presented from an out-of-class activity associated
   with university-level language courses involving a quest-type AR game
   called ChronoOps. Video data of 3-player groups were transcribed using
   conventions from multimodal conversation analysis. The empirical
   investigation illustrates meaning making through visible embodied
   displays, the performance of new actions through incorporation of public
   semiotic resources, and the contributions of the material surround as
   actants in the flow of interaction. Analysis illustrates that mobile AR
   activities enable languaging events among assemblages of environments,
   mobile devices, and embodied experience. We conclude by outlining the
   affordances of mobile AR activities as one example of rewilding
   approaches to creating material conditions for language use and
   learning.},

Abstract = {The intertwining of peer and teacher emotional support patterns for
   enhancing at-risk students' multi-perspective academic competencies
   remains scarcely mapped. The multi-level analysis in the present study
   uncovers emotional support trajectories within teacher-dyad and dyadic
   interaction contexts among at-risk elementary students over a
   three-semester computer-supported intervention. A cluster analysis was
   conducted for all students (n = 318), where most intervention students
   had cumulated risks in socio-motivational and reading competencies. The
   time spent by 12 dyads within the two interaction contexts was analyzed
   from a vast amount of video data. The results suggested that simply
   allocating support time may be insufficient and its quality should be
   scrutinized. An in-depth video analysis of four dyads, illustrated with
   interaction excerpts and summary figures, indicated that teachers
   differed in their ability to calibrate their emotional support
   dynamically. The dyadic interactions of at-risk students were mostly
   on-task and neutral or positive. The intertwining of teacher-dyad and
   dyadic emotional support indicated that mechanisms positively
   contributed to enhancing multi-perspective academic competencies,
   although some risks were noted. Acknowledging the emotional states of
   others and successfully regulating one's own emotions were critical.
   Thus, infusing support for emotional competence and regulation
   strategies into both teacher and basic education is recommended.},

Title = {Making L2 learners' reasoning skills visible: The potential of Computer
   Supported Collaborative Learning Environments},
Journal = {THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {303-322},
Abstract = {This paper explores the use of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning
   Environments (CSCLE) as multimodal spaces for promoting critical
   thinking for English as Second Language Learning (L2) education from
   multiple perspectives (Technology, Thinking Skills and Interaction). The
   exploration focuses on the use of a multitouch tabletop, and an
   accompanying application called Digital Mysteries, as affordances in
   CSCLE's for making reasoning skill-based thinking visible for L2
   learning in Higher Education.
   Despite the worldwide promotion of teaching thinking in L2 education, it
   is not always easy for teachers to identify the types of thinking skills
   being targeted in L2 pedagogical tasks. To the authors' knowledge,
   little empirical interactional evidence is available to demonstrate
   critical thinking in L2 learner talk during group work. This paper
   examines interactions among three groups of Chinese English Language
   learners at a higher education institution in a CSCLE. Video data were
   collected of students' thinking-in-action whilst engaging in multimodal
   interactions in the environment. Results show that new technologies can
   provide innovative and empirically driven ways in which L2 learners'
   thinking is externalised and how critical reasoning can be tracked,
   promoted, evaluated and self regulated. The findings suggest that
   collaborations in a CSCLE can support the completion of tasks embedding
   high levels of cognitive complexity by L2 learners with effective use of
   limited cognitive resources. This leads to a number of recommendations
   about integrating the teaching of critical thinking skills into the L2
   classroom using CSCLE technologies. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {To obtain a general understanding of science, model use as part of
   National Education Standards is important for instruction. Model use can
   be characterized by three aspects: (1) the characteristics of the model,
   (2) the integration of the model into instruction, and (3) the use of
   models to foster scientific reasoning. However, there were no empirical
   results describing the implementation of National Education Standards in
   science instruction concerning the use of models. Therefore, the present
   study investigated the implementation of different aspects of model use
   in German biology instruction. Two biology lessons on the topic
   neurobiology in grade nine of 32 biology teachers were videotaped (N=64
   videos). These lessons were analysed using an event-based coding manual
   according to three aspects of model described above. Rasch analysis of
   the coded categories was conducted and showed reliable measurement. In
   the first analysis, we identified 68 lessons where a total of 112
   different models were used. The in-depth analysis showed that special
   aspects of an elaborate model use according to several categories of
   scientific reasoning were rarely implemented in biology instruction. A
   critical reflection of the used model (N=25 models; 22.3\%) and models
   to demonstrate scientific reasoning (N=26 models; 23.2\%) were seldom
   observed. Our findings suggest that pre-service biology teacher
   education and professional development initiatives in Germany have to
   focus on both aspects.},

Abstract = {This article reports on the results of a planning grant studying the
   effects of a highly rated curriculum unit on a diverse student
   population. The treatment was introduced to 1500 eighth grade students
   in five middle schools selected for their ethnic, linguistic, and
   socioeconomic diversity. Students were given pre-, post-, and delayed
   posttests on a Conservation of Matter Assessment and measures of
   motivation and engagement. This quasi-experiment found statistically
   significant posttest results for achievement, basic learning engagement,
   and goal orientation. Analyses of disaggregated data showed that
   subgroups of students in the treatment condition outscored their
   comparison group peers (n = 1500) in achievement in all cases, except
   for students currently enrolled in ESOL. Analysis of video data of a
   diverse group of four students as the unit was enacted suggests that
   students entered a learning environment that permitted them to function
   in different, but consistent ways over time; that is, the frequency of
   students' manipulation of objects showed a different pattern of
   engagement for each of the four students compared with patterns of
   verbal responses such as the use of scientific terms. The results of
   this planning grant paved the way for a large study of the scale-up of
   highly rated curriculum units. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Advancements in machine learning have recently enabled the
   hyper-realistic synthesis of prose, images, audio and video data, in
   what is referred to as artificial intelligence (AI)-generated media.
   These techniques offer novel opportunities for creating interactions
   with digital portrayals of individuals that can inspire and intrigue us.
   AI-generated portrayals of characters can feature synthesized faces,
   bodies and voices of anyone, from a fictional character to a historical
   figure, or even a deceased family member. Although negative use cases of
   this technology have dominated the conversation so far, in this
   Perspective we highlight emerging positive use cases of AI-generated
   characters, specifically in supporting learning and well-being. We
   demonstrate an easy-to-use AI character generation pipeline to enable
   such outcomes and discuss ethical implications as well as the need for
   including traceability to help maintain trust in the generated media. As
   we look towards the future, we foresee generative media as a crucial
   part of the ever growing landscape of human-AI interaction.
   Digitally recreating the likeness of a person used to be a costly and
   complex process. Through the use of generative models, AI-generated
   characters can now be made with relative ease. Pataranutaporn et al.
   discuss in this Perspective how this technology can be used for positive
   applications in education and well-being.},

Title = {Learning from below: A micro-ethnographic account of children's
   self-determination as sociopolitical and intellectual action},
Journal = {LEARNING CULTURE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper argues for an amplification of the everyday intellectual and
   political gestures of children as valuable indices and movers of
   learning. We identify and focus on microacts of self-determination,
   defined here as, ``as contestations and moves to elsewhere that shift
   activity and dictate future status{''}. In particular, we consider if
   and how such microacts that could be cast as idiosyncratic build and
   shape new possibilities for learning and social interaction, what we
   refer to here as learning from below. Learning from below reflects an
   effort to move beyond the binary of individual versus collective
   activity and to situate scholarship on social and historical movements
   and forms of decolonial insurgency as germane to sociocultural and
   interactional studies of learning. Drawing from an extensive data set
   which included ethnographic fieldnotes, semi-structured interviews, and
   over 70 hours of video data collected from an after-school community
   tinkering program, we found that children's everyday forms of
   self-determination were much more than individual acts; they emerge from
   social histories and carried future potentialities that shaped learning
   and intellectual life within the setting. This central finding is
   anchored in an analysis of over 600 examples, as well as two cases that
   look more closely at individual children's participation.},

Journal = {ENGLISH TEACHING-PRACTICE AND CRITIQUE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},

Pages = {387-399},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine, through an
   intersectional lens, how digital video composing can be an act of
   redistributive social justice for students with learning disabilities.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors draw on two years' worth of
   observation, interview, survey and digital video data to present a case
   study of Javier (all names are pseudonyms), a Latinx English Learner
   with several learning disabilities. The authors worked with him, making
   digital videos in a general education classroom as part of a larger
   design-based study. The authors describe how he made meaning in various
   modes, across modes, and how his intersectional identities inflected his
   meaning-making and were visible in his video artifacts.
   Findings Javier was an able digital composer, made meaning across modes
   and was attentive to audience. His videos offer a portrait of a child
   with learning disabilities navigating his complex cultural worlds.
   Research limitations/implications This is a single case study built to
   bridge multiple theoretical and disciplinary backgrounds. Javier was
   able to compose semiotically powerful messages with socially powerful
   digital tools.
   Originality/value The authors argue that the use of such tools is a
   chance for redistributive social justice. Children traditionally
   underserved by innovations in digital making should not be left out.},

Title = {Chapter 3: Waking Up Woke: Exploring Black Female Youth Critical
   Consciousness and Sociopolitical Development},
Journal = {TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {123},
Number = {13},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background/Context: Critical consciousness (CC) is an awareness and
   reflection of inequities, political efficacy, and agency in response to
   injustice. Similarly, sociopolitical development (SPD) is the process of
   developing a critical understanding, skill set, and emotional depth to
   enact individual agency against oppressive forces. Of the latter, SPD is
   vital in empowering youth from traditionally marginalized communities to
   challenge inequities. However, SPD has largely remained absent from U.S.
   classrooms.
   Purpose/Objective/ Research Question/Focus of Study: Considering the
   absence of SPD in U.S. classrooms, this case study explores the SPD of
   Black female preservice teachers and their Black female high school
   mentees in a two-year tutoring and mentoring school-based program. Our
   study captures the woke pedagogical experiences that advanced
   participants' co-constructed CC. As such, we seek to describe student
   exemplars of what it means to be awakened and stay woke through an
   analysis of interviews, journal reflections, and video data. To this
   end, the research question that guided this study was: What are the
   perspectives of Black female youth as they co-construct CC toward SPD in
   a two-year tutoring and mentoring school-based program?
   Research Design: Through the lenses of critical race feminism and woke
   pedagogies, this study used a single case study design. Case study is
   appropriate for this study because it highlights the particularity and
   complexities of one unit of analysis.
   Findings: Our findings capture the perspectives of Black female youth as
   they cultivate CC toward sociopolitical development in one educational
   initiative geared toward partnering undergraduate and high school
   students. An examination of data through the lens of critical race
   feminism and woke pedagogies spotlighted the perspectives of our
   participants as they co-constructed CC through woke pedagogical
   experiences. Mentors deepened their CC on race, and mentees gained
   heightened awareness of gendered and racialized school procedures and
   policies. Black girls in this study woke up (CC) and stayed woke through
   their activism (SPD).
   Conclusions: In sharing the perspectives of Black female youth as they
   cultivated SPD, it is our intention that the critical approach and
   experiences that we have described capture the methods and strategies
   that one educational initiative implemented to empower and promote
   agency among Black female students. As an example of woke pedagogy, this
   educational initiative offered Black girls at the intersection of race,
   gender, and class an opportunity to critically question their world and
   become aware of racial and social injustices impacting their everyday
   lives and community.},

Title = {Emotion, place, and practice: Exploring the interplay in children's
   engagement in ecologists' sampling practices},
Journal = {SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {106},
Number = {3},
Pages = {610-644},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In science education, there has been a sustained focus on supporting the
   emergence of science practices in K-12 and field-based settings. Recent
   work has elevated the integral role of emotion in sparking and
   sustaining such disciplinary practices, deepening the field's
   understanding of what is entailed in ``doing{''} science. Yet even as we
   gain this richer understanding of practice, less attention has been
   given to the places where practice emerges. These places play a critical
   role in the co-emergence of emotion and practice, and while separate
   strands of research have elevated emotion and practice or, alternately,
   place and practice, rarely has their dynamic relationship been
   considered together. In this article, I explore this interplay of
   emotion, place, and practice emergent in children's sampling practices
   within a multiweek curriculum centered around their schoolyard soil
   ecosystem. Through a comparative case study analysis of two student
   pairs using video data, student interviews, and classroom artifacts, my
   analysis reveals how children's emergent emotion was entangled in their
   relationships with the schoolyard and life within, shaping not only how
   they engaged in sampling practices but also what dimensions of the
   ecological system they attended to. I argue that emotion and place
   should be central to the design, teaching, and analysis of learning
   contexts, in turn centering the social and emplaced dimensions of
   science disciplinary practices for children and scientists alike.
   Implications for science teaching and learning are discussed, with
   particular consideration of field-based sciences.},

Abstract = {There is increasing recognition of the multimodal representational
   nature of science discovery practices and the roles of multiple and
   multimodal representations in students' meaning making in science
   (Lemke,1998; Tytler, Prain, Hubber, \& Waldrip,2013; Tang,International
   Journal of Science Education, 38(13), 2069-2095,2016). However, research
   in this area is only starting to explore how these different modal
   meanings interact (Tytler, Prain, Aranda, Ferguson, \& Gorur,2020) and
   particularly of the nature of the `transduction' (Airey \&
   Linder,Journal of Research in Science Teaching: The Official Journal of
   the National Association for Research in Science Teaching,46(1),
   27-49,2009) or `re-description' (Lehrer \& Schauble,2013) of one modal
   representation to another and their coordination in model-based
   reasoning in science. This paper explores ways in which groups of
   secondary students orchestrated multimodal representations to gain an
   understanding of the lever principle in a collaborative learning
   environment of a Science of Learning Research Classroom. The analysis of
   video data and student artefacts suggests that mathematical formulations
   on their own were limited in allowing students to satisfactorily engage
   with science ideas and that a key feature of cross-modal translation is
   the flexibility in application of these ideas afforded by the different
   modes and understanding the nature of these interactions. Using a
   Peircean socio-semiotic approach (Peirce,1992,1998) and Pickering's
   notion of scientific research involving a `mangle of practice'
   (Pickering,1995, p. 23), this paper argues that a robust understanding
   of the lever principle necessarily involves students coordinating a
   range of modal representations, including visual-spatial, manipulative,
   embodied and abstract mathematical drawing on the distinctive
   affordances each brings to learning. We also describe the way these
   representations push back on learners in unexpected ways.},

Title = {Nurse-surgeon object transfer: Video analysis of communication and
   situation awareness in the operating theatre},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {51},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1195-1206},

Abstract = {Background: One of the most central collaborative tasks during surgical
   operations is the passing of objects, including instruments. Little is
   known about how nurses and surgeons achieve this. The aim of the present
   study was to explore what factors affect this routine-like task,
   resulting in fast or slow transfer of objects.
   Methods: A qualitative video study, informed by an observational
   ethnographic approach, was conducted in a major teaching hospital in the
   UK. A total of 20 general surgical operations were observed. In total,
   approximately 68 h of video data have been reviewed. A subsample of 225
   min has been analysed in detail using interactional video-analysis
   developed within the social sciences.
   Results: Two factors affecting object transfer were observed: (1)
   relative instrument trolley position and (2) alignment. The scrub
   nurse's instrument trolley position (close to vs. further back from the
   surgeon) and alignment (gaze direction) impacts on the communication
   with the surgeon, and consequently, on the speed of object transfer.
   When the scrub nurse was standing close to the surgeon, and
   ``converged{''} to follow the surgeon's movements, the transfer occurred
   more seamlessly and faster (<1.0s) than when the scrub nurse was
   standing further back from the surgeon and did not follow the surgeon's
   movements (>1.0s).
   Conclusions: The smoothness of object transfer can be improved by
   adjusting the scrub nurse's instrument trolley position, enabling a
   better monitoring of surgeon's bodily conduct and affording early
   orientation (awareness) to an upcoming request (changing situation).
   Object transfer is facilitated by the surgeon's embodied practices,
   which can elicit the nurse's attention to the request and, as a
   response, maximise a faster object transfer. A simple intervention to
   highlight the significance of these factors could improve communication
   in the operating theatre. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Young children's social and independent behavior during play with a
   coding app: Digital game features matter in a 1:1 child to tablet
   setting},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Volume = {190},

Abstract = {The overarching aim of this study was to explore young children's (N =
   25, Mage = 5.16 years) play with two coding games (Daisy the Dinosaur
   and Kodable) in a 1:1 child to tablet setting. We had three research
   questions focused on children's game play: 1) How does the structure of
   each game influence children's play? 2) Do children play more or less
   independently depending on the game they play? 3) Do children who play
   the games more independently learn more coding skills? Three researchers
   coded more than 6 h of video data showing children's play with digital
   coding games. Findings include, that the type of game did influence the
   different ways that children behaved while playing. However, during both
   games, children had the same amount of inde-pendent play. Children who
   played more independently during Daisy the Dinosaur learned more coding
   skills. This may be because these children were focusing more on the
   game than their peers as we did not find a similar effect for the game
   Kodable. We discuss the ways that children play structured vs. open
   structured (i.e., sandbox) digital games with a particular focus on how
   game play may influence learning. As opportunities for individual device
   ownership in classrooms increase, future work should continue to explore
   how game features influence learning.},

Abstract = {Although extensive research has shown the educational value of different
   types of interactive visualizations on students' science learning in
   general, how such technologies can contribute to English learners' (ELs)
   understanding of complex scientific concepts has not been sufficiently
   explored to date. This mixed-methods study investigated how interactive
   dynamic and static visualizations embedded in web-based inquiry
   instruction can support ELs and non-ELs in developing a coherent
   understanding of energy and matter transformations in life science. A
   total of 331 seventh-grade ELs and non-ELs were randomly assigned to a
   dynamic or a static visualization condition. During inquiry instruction,
   students in the dynamic group explored interactive dynamic
   visualizations of energy and matter transformations; students in the
   static group explored static, yet otherwise equivalent, interactive
   visualizations. The results show that, while both forms of
   visualizations were beneficial for students, dynamic visualizations had
   significant advantages for improving all students' understanding of the
   target concepts. Our analyses of video data revealed that ELs and
   non-ELs in the dynamic condition engaged in more talk turns to interpret
   the scientific phenomena using both visual and textual representations,
   whereas ELs and non-ELs in the static condition appeared to rely on
   textual information to obtain new ideas about the scientific phenomena
   from the visualization. Compared to the static group, students in the
   dynamic group also more successfully evaluated and consolidated a range
   of ideas to develop coherent scientific explanations using evidence from
   the visualization. This study provides evidence that interactive dynamic
   visualizations have promise for supporting science learning for all
   students, including ELs who are often underserved in mainstream science
   classrooms. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 10:

Title = {Pedagogy Analysis Framework: a video-based tool for combining teacher,

Abstract = {Background: dialogue between the teaching profession and researchers
   regarding pedagogical strategy is sometimes problematic. Pedagogy
   research may benefit from incorporating research methods that can
   investigate teachers' and pupils' interpretations.
   Purpose: this research expands the Pedagogy Analysis Framework (Riordan,
   2020) by explaining in detail the meso-strategies (tactics) and a
   macro-strategy (grand strategy) used by participants in three school
   science lessons about chromatography. The research design builds on
   previous work by using full lessons and introducing pupil group verbal
   protocols. In addition, Pedagogy Analysis Notation is introduced to help
   understand and explain macro-strategic behaviours.
   Sample: one class of thirty 13-year-old pupils and one science teacher.
   Design and method: four research methods were used (lesson video
   analysis, teacher verbal protocols, pupil group verbal protocols and
   researcher group interviews). Data were video recorded (managed using
   NVivo). Fourteen hours of video data were analysed using Grounded Theory
   Methods by two educational researchers and the class teacher. The
   interpretivist theoretical perspective (symbolic interactionism) was
   underpinned by a social constructionist epistemology (hence the
   methodology is Straussian Grounded Theory). Appropriate criteria for
   evaluating the emergent grounded theory were used. Data were recorded in
   2017.
   Results: the Pedagogy Analysis Framework uses the concepts: means (human
   and non-human), strategy (a spectrum from micro-strategies (actions),
   through meso-strategies (tactics) to macro-strategies (grand
   strategies)), ends (regarding the self, another person or a thing, or a
   group of people or things), and accidents. Types of tactics identified
   in these data were: inform (misinform and disinform), question,
   instruct, use space/time, repeat, train, assess, and interact. Pedagogy
   Analysis Notation is used to understand and explain `the stationary
   {[}sic] cupboard' incident.
   Conclusion: the extended Pedagogy Analysis Framework, combined with the
   Pedagogy Analysis Notation, improves strategic dialogue between
   teachers, pupils and educational researchers. This research design
   facilitates comparison of interpretations of classroom pedagogy by a
   teacher, pupils and two researchers.},

Title = {Understanding and explaining pedagogical problem solving: a video-based
   grounded theory study of classroom pedagogy},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 NOV 17},
Abstract = {Background during school lessons participants can face challenging
   pedagogical problems such as when science and religion topics interact.
   Potential types of pedagogical problem and what participants can do in
   response are unclear. Research designs exploring pedagogical problem
   solving should investigate teachers' thinking processes and include
   pupil interpretations. Purpose This theoretical paper builds on the
   Pedagogy Analysis Framework by integrating it with pedagogical
   problem-solving theory, illustrating the resultant extended Pedagogy
   Analysis Framework and Pedagogical Problem Typology using data from a
   video-based study of one science and one Religious Education (RE)
   lesson. The research design also builds on previous work by exploring
   primary school and RE pedagogy. Sample One class of thirty 7-year-old
   pupils, and another class of 10-year-olds, each with their class teacher
   and teaching assistants. Design and Method Four research methods were
   used (lesson video analysis, teacher verbal protocols, pupil group
   verbal protocols and individual teacher interviews). Data were video
   recorded (managed using NVivo). Six hours of video data were analysed
   using grounded theory methods by two educational researchers, the class
   teacher and two groups of pupils (three girls and three boys). The
   interpretivist theoretical perspective (symbolic interactionism) was
   underpinned by a social constructionist epistemology (hence the
   methodology is Straussian grounded theory). Appropriate criteria for
   evaluating the emergent grounded theory were used. Data were recorded in
   2019. Results This paper presents an extended Pedagogy Analysis
   Framework and a Pedagogical Problem Typology both illustrated with
   examples. Conclusion The Extended Pedagogy Analysis Framework and
   Pedagogical Problem Typology can help during pedagogy analysis to
   identify, understand and explain common and less common types of
   pedagogical problem. Novice-expert strategic dialogue can struggle for
   want of a shared vocabulary. This research design works with younger and
   older children.},

Journal = {THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {1-16},

Abstract = {This research expands our understanding on the role of interactive
   technologies to draw learners into a dialogic space capable to promote
   ways of thinking creatively together. Grounded on dialogic theory, the
   research examines and characterizes the emergence of co-creative
   processes in an interactive technology framework. To this end, this
   paper reports on an empirical study with secondary-school students who
   followed a technology-enhanced dialogic pedagogy that promotes
   co-creativity in real secondary-education classrooms. Qualitative
   methodology was used to document real-life multimodal interaction. The
   video data was processed in different phases to develop an analytical
   framework capable of identifying strings of episodes indicating typical
   facets of technology-enhanced co-creative processes. Results provided
   seven typical co-creative facets: 1) collective framing of the task; 2)
   overcoming technological challenges; 3) engagement in generating a
   shared pool of ideas; 4) developing intersubjectivity; 5) fusing ideas
   for a new perspective; 6) evaluation of ideas and 7) making ideas a
   reality. Furthermore, the findings show that each co-creative facet
   covers specific objectives in the co-creativity cycle and presents
   distinct features along three key dimensions: a) co-creative processes
   involved, b) typical discourse features and, c) dialogic use of specific
   technology affordances (e.g. visibility, interactivity, responsiveness,
   multimodal representation, provisional, stability, re-usability) for
   co-creating. Future educational implications to design a more effective
   technology-enhanced dialogic pedagogy that can connect learners to their
   creative potential are also discussed.},

Abstract = {According to the Swedish Preschool Curriculum, one of the tasks of the
   preschool is to pass on a cultural heritage, its values, traditions and
   history, language and knowledge, from one generation to the next. The
   formulation indicates that cultural heritage plays an important role in
   defining the tasks of preschool teachers as far as the transmission of
   cultural norms is concerned.
   The aim of the overall study was to explore how Swedish preschool
   teachers implement and reflect on the task of transmitting a cultural
   heritage. This paper has its focus on how a particular cultural
   tradition, Easter, is celebrated in two preschools.
   The empirical data consists of 227 min video data from two preschools.
   The video data were analysed through qualitative content analysis with a
   focus on how different semiotic resources, actions and artefacts are
   used to perform Easter.
   The different modes of enacting traditions are used as instruments of
   socialisation into a cultural heritage as well as means of actualisation
   of a preschool pedagogy. While preschool teachers can be seen as agents
   of change who challenge some of the ways of celebrating a tradition,
   they are also agents of national reproduction. Thus, the teachers both
   enact the curriculum and build a bricolage of elements, some of which
   represent continuity, while others represent change.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies on science teaching have shown that we should revise
   the way that science is taught in our schools, and promote pedagogical
   practices based on inquiry-based methods. Inquiry-based science
   education has proved its efficiency at both primary and secondary levels
   in increasing students' interest and attainments while at the same time
   stimulating teacher motivation. This paper presents an innovative way to
   introduce inquiry based methods in the science classroom using advanced
   technological applications. The Lab of Tomorrow system consists of a
   series of tiny, programmable devices that are embedded in clothing,
   footballs and other items. The system monitors the wearer's running
   pace, body temperature, heartbeat rate or the acceleration of a ball.
   This practical information can be translated into examples of science
   theory, raising interest and motivation among students, and improving
   the learning process. In this way student everyday activities are
   becoming a subject of experimentation. They personally experience the
   procedures involved in an authentic research project and thereby gain a
   far better understanding of science. This paper describes the systematic
   procedure that was adapted to monitor students' and teachers' activities
   while using the Lab of Tomorrow system. Four hundred students from 18
   schools in Greece, Germany, Austria and Italy were involved in the study
   for a period of 8 months (one school year) during their science lessons.
   Quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed in detail.
   The analysis of the findings demonstrates that there is significant
   improvement of the learning outcomes for the students in all cases in
   both physics and mathematics. Additionally, the outcomes of the extended
   lesson video study demonstrate that the Lab of Tomorrow system offers a
   great opportunity for teachers to adopt inquiry based methods in their
   lessons, and to implement teaching strategies for facilitating learning
   about scientific inquiry, developing the abilities of inquiry, and
   understanding scientific concepts and principles.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to explore how students experience and describe
   socio-cognitive and socio-emotional challenges in collaborative
   learning. The participants (N = 20) were teacher education students
   whose collaborative learning was supported with a designed regulation
   macro script during a six-week mathematics course. The purpose of the
   script was to provide structured phases during the collaborative
   learning tasks for the group members to plan, monitor, and evaluate
   their workings. The video data of groups' face-to-face work was
   collected and analysed by focusing on the different types of challenges
   the groups experienced and the types of challenges they described during
   the scripted interaction. The results indicate that the groups
   experienced more socio-cognitive challenges than socio-emotional
   challenges. The script provided them a moment to verbalize their
   emotional experiences, name the emotions (i.e. frustration), and
   attribute the challenges and emotions more precisely than during their
   mathematical task. The intertwining characteristics of socio-cognitive
   and socio-emotional challenges were observable. Collaborative learning
   can be challenging for groups, and thus, the knowledge of and the
   ability to implement practices for becoming aware of challenges can
   provide a direction for students to progress towards more productive
   collaboration.},

Title = {Affective states and regulation of learning during socio-emotional

Abstract = {Background Group affective states for learning are constantly formed
   through socio-emotional interactions. However, it remains unclear how
   the affective states vary during collaboration and how they occur with
   regulation of learning. Appropriate methods are needed to track both
   group affective states and these interaction processes. Aims The present
   study identifies different socio-emotional interaction episodes during
   groups' collaborative learning and examines how group affective states
   fluctuate with regulation of learning during these episodes. Sample The
   participants were 54 secondary school students working in groups across
   four science learning sessions. Methods Multichannel process data
   (video, electrodermal activity {[}EDA]) were collected in an authentic
   classroom. Groups' affective states were measured with emotional valence
   captured from video data, and activation captured as sympathetic arousal
   from EDA data. Regulation of learning was observed from the videotaped
   interactions. Results The study disclosed four clusters of
   socio-emotional interaction episodes (positive, negative, occasional
   regulation, frequent regulation), which differed in terms of fluctuation
   of affective states and activated regulation of learning. These
   clustered episodes confirm how affective states are constantly reset by
   socio-emotional interactions and regulation of learning. The results
   also show that states requiring regulation do not automatically lead to
   its activation. Conclusions By advancing existing understanding of how
   group level socio-emotional processes contribute to regulation of
   learning, the study has implications for educational design and
   psychological practice. Methodologically, it contributes to
   collaborative learning research by employing multiple data channels
   (including biophysiological measures) to explore the various dimensions
   of socio-emotional processes in groups.},

Abstract = {Purpose Student engagement is typically measured by class attendance and
   questionnaires. Learning management systems (LMS) provide additional
   sources of objective data that can evaluate student performance. This
   study compared dental students' self-report of course video viewing with
   LMS data.
   Methods Dental students in a 2018 flipped pediatric dentistry course
   were given a questionnaire after course completion that captured
   self-reported course video viewing. Student data and time spent on
   videos were extracted from the LMS and matched to the questionnaire.
   McNemar's test evaluated differences between self-reported and matching
   LMS data.
   Results Of the 109 enrolled students, 99 (91\%) completed the
   questionnaire. Most students self-reported that they watched more than
   half of the videos (71\%), re-watched at least once (89\%), and watched
   at times other than 8 a.m.-5 p.m. (80\%). Of the 104 students with data
   from the LMS, 40\% of students watched more than half of the videos,
   49\% re-watched at least one video, and 60\% watched between 8 a.m.-5
   p.m. LMS data showed 14 (13\%) students did not watch any videos.
   Significant differences were found between self-reported video viewing
   and matched LMS video data in (1) percentage of videos watched, (2)
   number of times videos were re-watched, and (3) most frequent time for
   watching the videos (p < 0.001 for all).
   Conclusion Technology is a tool that helps instructors more accurately
   track students' study habits compared to observation or self-report.
   When evaluating time spent watching videos via an LMS, students tend to
   overestimate the amount of viewing time.},

Title = {From Words to Concepts: Focusing on Word Knowledge When Teaching for

Journal = {RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {44},
Number = {5},
Pages = {777-800},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This qualitative video study explores how two elementary school teachers
   taught for conceptual understanding throughout different phases of
   science inquiry. The teachers implemented teaching materials with a
   focus on learning science key concepts through the development of word
   knowledge. A framework for word knowledge was applied to examine the
   students' level of word knowledge manifested in their talk. In this
   framework, highly developed knowledge of a word is conceptual knowledge.
   This includes understanding how the word is situated within a network of
   other words and ideas. The results suggest that students' level of word
   knowledge develops toward conceptual knowledge when the students are
   required to apply the key concepts in their talk throughout all phases
   of inquiry. When the students become familiar with the key concepts
   through the initial inquiry activities, the students use the concepts as
   tools for furthering their conceptual understanding when they discuss
   their ideas and findings. However, conceptual understanding is not
   promoted when teachers do the talking for the students, rephrasing their
   responses into the correct answer or neglecting to address the students'
   everyday perceptions of scientific phenomena.},

   setting in their classroom, and work collaboratively in teams on game
   design. The study draws on qualitative video data from six team cases
   using a coding scheme of categories for the concepts of task,
   collaborative information seeking (CIS) Modality, and inquiry resolution
   outcomes. The study also considers linkages between processes and
   learning outcomes. Variation in engagement across the categories among
   students was charted, and certain patterns emerged. Findings indicate
   that some categories of task appear related to some categories of
   students' chosen CIS Modality for solving problems. Further, CIS
   processes in support of tasks appear related to inquiry incident
   resolution (resolved/unresolved). For student completion of advanced
   programming tasks in particular, we observe more frequent uses of the
   wiki-based LMS resources, and greater levels of challenge in fulfilling
   tasks. Results support existing work on these theoretical constructs in
   the information sciences, and lead to questions on how naturalistic
   emergence of CIS practices result from greater task knowledge, and
   whether learned CIS practices (as tasks in and of themselves) can yield
   project task knowledge gains. Findings of the study and the ongoing
   questions the work invites hold instructional design implications, and
   show how social constructivist educational contexts involving
   collaborative and information seeking and knowledge building among youth
   game designers can contribute to scholarly understanding of these
   processes more broadly in related project-based work contexts occurring
   among both youth and adults.},

Abstract = {Investigating the temporal order of regulatory processes can explain in
   more detail the mechanisms behind success or lack of success during
   collaborative learning. The aim of this study is to explore the
   differences between high- and low-challenge collaborative learning
   sessions. This is achieved through examining how the three phases of
   self-regulated learning occur in a collaborative setting and the types
   of interaction associated with these phases. The participants were
   teacher training students (N = 44), who worked in groups on a complex
   task related to didactics of mathematics during 6 weeks. The
   participants were instructed to use an application that was designed to
   increase awareness of the cognitive, motivational and emotional
   challenges the group might face. Based on the application's log files,
   the sessions were categorized into low- and high-challenge sessions. The
   video data from each session were coded based on the self-regulation
   phases and the types of interaction. The frequencies of the phases and
   the types of interaction were calculated for each session, and process
   discovery methods were applied using the heuristic miner algorithm. The
   results show no significant differences between the sessions in the
   frequency of phases. However, the process models of the two sessions
   were different: in the high-challenge sessions, the groups switched
   between the forethought and performance phases more. In conclusion, the
   regulation phases and types of interaction that contribute to successful
   collaboration differ in high- and low challenge sessions and support for
   regulated learning is needed especially at the middle of the learning
   process.},

Title = {Is there an increase over time in the complexity of teacher questions
   and student responses in case-based clinical seminars? A cross-sectional
   video study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Background: Case-based group discussions (CBGD) are a specific,
   interaction-focused format dedicated to fostering medical students'
   skills in applying basic biomedical knowledge to patient cases. Existing
   conceptions of CBGD suggest that a gradient towards increased
   opportunities for students to make elaborative verbal contributions is
   an important element of such seminars. To verify this assumption, we
   investigate empirically if clinical teachers progress from more basic,
   knowledge-oriented questions towards more advanced, elaboration-oriented
   questions in such seminars. Methods: We videotaped 21 different clinical
   teachers and 398 medical students in 32 CBGD-seminars on surgery and
   internal medicine. We coded closed-reproductive and open-elaborative
   teacher questions as well as reproductive and elaborative student
   responses to these questions. Inter-rater reliability was satisfactory.
   To determine trends regarding the teacher questions / student responses,
   we compared eight time-segments of equal duration per seminar. Results:
   Overall, clinical teachers asked more closed-reproductive than
   open-elaborative questions. Students gave more reproductive than
   elaborative responses. Regarding the frequencies of these forms of
   teacher questions / student responses, we found no significant
   differences over time. Conclusions: Clinical teachers did not
   deliberately modify the types of questions over time to push students
   towards more elaborative responses. We conclude that the critical
   question to which degree promising teaching approaches are actually put
   into clinical teaching practice should be raised more purposefully in
   medical education research.},

Abstract = {School-preparation activities are central for Norwegian children in
   their final year in pre-schools, but school-preparation activity is an
   understudied practice. This article gains insight in children's
   participation in school-preparation activities using video data
   collected in a pre-school over a 7-month period. Various forms of
   preparation activities took place on a weekly basis, such as trips,
   projects and drawing. Children's verbal and embodied actions in a
   letter-based activity was studied over time, and the children oriented
   to each other as competitors, supported each other and constructed
   playful action. The pre-school teachers facilitated and allowed for the
   children to form the activity.},

   proposes to investigate how apprentices engage in questioning practices

   questions do not constitute the dominant form of questioning work
   observed. Alternative interactional patterns that stress the tensions
   connected with questioning in the workplace context and the complexity
   of the social practices associated with workplace learning are
   identified and described. These findings illuminate the challenges faced
   by apprentices when joining the workplace and underscore the importance
   of a sociopragmatic perspective in addressing social issues related to

Abstract = {The study investigated variant and invariant physics teaching patterns
   across time and topics. It is assumed that the analysis perspective is
   decisive for identifying variant and invariant teaching patterns.
   Therefore, we focused on three perspectives: (1) organisation of
   activities, (2) quality of teacher-student interactions, and (3)
   students' perception of learning conditions. The design included three
   lessons of two topics (13 classes x 2 topics x 3 lessons) that were
   videotaped in each class. The findings indicate variants in teaching for
   the organisation of activities. Invariants were identified for
   teacher-student interactions and the students' perception of learning
   conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {THEORY INTO PRACTICE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {91-98},
Abstract = {In the ideal, reciprocity in qualitative inquiiy occurs when there is
   give-and-take between researchers and the researched; however, the
   demands of the academy and resource constraints often make the pursuit
   of reciprocity difficult. Drawing on two video-based, qualitative
   studies in which researchers utilized video records as resources to
   enhance reciprocity, this article explores how educators and researchers
   can negotiate relationships to make the research enterprise mutually
   beneficial. In particular, this article examines specific events where
   researchers and educators collaboratively analyzed video data, including
   video of the research team engaged in analytic conversations. The
   resulting conversations interrupted traditional boundaries between
   researchers and participants and yielded understandings that benefited
   both parties. The conclusion provides a set of questions educators can
   pose to researchers to help ensure reciprocity.},

   were collected. The results show that the well-performing group was more
   engaged in high-level knowledge co-construction and monitoring
   activities. The well-performing group was also capable of maintaining a
   higher level throughout the tasks, whereas the lower performing groups'
   knowledge co-construction and monitoring activities was reduced during

Volume = {75},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We investigated biology instruction-using a generic framework of
   scientific reasoning and argumentation (SRA) with eight epistemic
   activities-on how to foster student learning in biological literacy
   which had not been clarified in previous studies. Our analysis of
   videotaped biology lessons and student achievement showed varying
   frequencies in using these activities and their effects on achievement.
   Those students taught with more epistemic activities had higher
   achievement. We believe that the SRA framework can be a worthwhile
   methodical tool for teaching biology to foster student learning.
   Therefore, we draw practically orientated implications for educational
   research, practitioners, teacher educators, and curriculum developers.

Abstract = {This study investigates the sociomaterial movements of student
   engagement in a school's makerspace. Here, we understand sociomaterial
   movements as emergent and relational, comprising complex dynamics of
   agency across students, teachers and materials in situated, culturally
   framed activities. Our study draws on data comprising 85 hours of video
   recordings of 9-12-year-old students' (N = 94) engagement in a
   technology-rich makerspace in a Finnish elementary school. The video
   data were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively using a multimodal
   interaction analysis. The sociomaterial movements were found to be
   displayed across a tension-laden continuum between (1) procedural
   activity-analysis and reflection; (2) individual activity-collaboration;
   (3) ``doing school{''}-empowerment; and d) alienation-identification.
   Together, the study offers a potential approach for investigating and
   understanding the often overlooked workings of sociomateriality that
   constitutes students' emergent engagement and learning opportunities in
   science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEAM) learning
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Using a multi-case study methodology, this research describes the
   curricular beliefs of 7 Chilean Physics teachers. A semi-structured
   interview was applied with 30 questions distributed in three dimensions:
   contents, teaching methodology and evaluation. In addition, their
   classes were observed and recorded on video. Data gathered were analysed
   with the software MAXQDA. The analysis focused on the difficulties that
   these teachers faced when teaching the uniform rectilinear movement
   (MRU). It is concluded that, in general terms, the beliefs were
   inconsistent with the teaching practices. It was also revealed that
   teachers are more constructivist when they talk about what they think is
   right and should be done than when they talk on what they will truly do
   in their teaching practices. Some conclusions on both the research in
   the field and the training of science teachers are provided.},

Abstract = {As the COVID-19 virus has spread worldwide, much attention has been paid
   to its impact on the health and wellbeing of adults, with less attention
   to how the virus has impacted on young children. This article draws on
   documentation and video data from a kindergarten in Aotearoa New
   Zealand. It discusses the working theories of 4 year-old children whose
   teachers encouraged them to draw, construct images, explain and tell
   stories about their experiences, ideas and feelings about the virus. A
   main argument is that children's working theories about the virus,
   knowledge of the virus and sense of personal control over keeping
   themselves safe developed over time. Arts-based and storytelling
   pedagogy were central in enabling children to communicate with others,
   to be understood themselves and to extend their own understanding.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION RESEARCH JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-50},
Abstract = {The data for this article were derived from a larger three-year study
   enquiring into how immigrant preschool teachers, and the families and
   children with whom they work, explore their bicultural identities
   through aesthetic representations of their sense of place. Eleven first
   generation immigrant parents and their young children attending a
   multicultural Canadian preschool participated in shared art-making
   workshops. Framed by a qualitative arts-based research methodology, data
   were collected using ethnographic methods. A multimodal interactional
   analysis of the video data elucidated the participants' rich, complex,
   embodied modes of communicating with each other. While research on
   parent-child interactions typically privileges verbal, face-to-face
   communications in which partners take turns leading and following each
   other's movements, this analysis revealed two additional interactional
   `dances'; mirroring the partner's movements and synchronising movements
   between partners. This research suggests new possibilities for
   discerning and including immigrant parents' culturally-influenced ways
   of interacting with their children in early childhood settings.},

Abstract = {This article explores the social and cognitive implications of sibling
   caregiving among the Zinacantec Maya of Mexico and the Wolof of Senegal.
   Ethnographic video data of sibling caregiving interactions were
   collected, focusing on children ages three to 13 years interacting with
   their two-year-old siblings. Sibling relations in both cultures reflect
   a system of multiage play, the children's sensitivity to age and gender
   hierarchies, and the older siblings' role as teachers of their younger
   siblings. Differences in the two groups include more verbal exchanges
   and wordplay with the two-year-old Wolof children and more overt efforts
   by older Zinacantec siblings to incorporate the two year olds into their
   group activity. The data indicate an overall pattern of cultural
   transmission by which older siblings teach younger ones in the context
   of caring for them. The pattern is nuanced by each group's social
   organization and rules for social interaction, exhibited in the
   children's play.},

Abstract = {This article investigates data reuse or the secondary analysis of
   qualitative data, specifically video records of practice in education,
   which are used to study the complex cognitive, social, and logistical
   issues involved in teaching and learning processes. It examines reuse
   through the lens of the invisibilities experienced by educational
   researchers who perform secondary analysis on video records of practice.
   Drawing on 22 in-depth interviews with educational researchers, we
   examine how they conceptualize secondary analysis of qualitative video
   data and cope with invisibilities in the data. For example, knowing the
   original research question was not sufficient: reusers needed to
   understand more about the intentionality of the data producer. They also
   sought more information on the reflexivity of the original researcher
   and how this influenced data production. Additionally, reusers discussed
   the creation of evidence from the video during secondary analysis as
   teaching and learning themselves entail invisible processes.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the organisation of correction in mobile
   instructional settings. Five sets of video data (>250 h) documenting how
   learners were instructed to fly aeroplanes, drive cars and ride bicycles
   in real life traffic were examined to reveal some common features of
   correction exchanges. Through detailed multimodal analysis of
   participants' actions, it is shown how instructors systematically
   elaborate their corrective instructions to include relevant information
   about the trouble and remedial action a practice we refer to as
   unpacking corrections. It is proposed that the practice of unpacking the
   local particulars of corrections (i) provides for the instructional
   character of the interaction, and (ii) is highly sensitive to the
   relevant physical and mobile contingencies. These findings contribute to
   the existing literature on the interactional organisation of correction
   and mobility, as well as to ongoing work in ethnomethodology and
   conversation analysis on teaching and learning as members' phenomena.

   violinist-teacher-researcher. The method adopted a single case study
   approach. Custodero's Flow Indicators in Musical Activities (FIMA) was
   cited in the videotaping documentation, and field notes were collected
   and reviewed. Certain portions of video data were selected for further
   review, and transcribed into verbal descriptions and analyzed using the
   FIMA as the analytical categories. Based on data collected in this case
   study, a description of Jiro's flow experiences during his violin
   playing was constructed. Findings included interpretations of Jiro's
   violin specific flow experiences, and critical examinations of very
   young children's violin learning which may suggest implications for
   future practice.},

Abstract = {This study examined situation-specific coping strategies of students

   A case study was conducted in a Finnish elementary school. 21
   ten-year-old students participated in the study. Two types of data were
   collected: ( 1) Students self-reported questionnaires on achievement
   goals, ( 2) Video data on the students' learning processes and social
   interaction. The results revealed the importance of a situative
   perspective in instructional design, since the students not only
   differed in their coping attempts regarding their initial goals but also
   according to their individual situational interpretations that mediated
   their active coping attempts. Some of the non-learning-focused students
   had difficulties engaging in the working procedures. A lack of teacher's
   concrete and precise guidance in both cognitive and motivational sense
   appeared to explain this phenomenon.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Using a video-cued interpretive research methodology, this study
   examines how eight doctoral students learn to become culturally
   responsive teacher educators in a foundation course in one of the first
   international teacher education Ph.D. programs in mainland China. We
   identified three patterns under girding the participants' learning
   experiences: (a) engaging with teacher education knowledge from
   culturally plural perspectives; (b) honing strategies for creating
   culturally inclusive learning experiences; and (c) developing
   asset-based views toward cultural diversity. These patterns constitute a
   conceptualization of the process of learning to become culturally
   responsive teacher educators and suggest practical implications for
   preparing culturally responsive teacher educators.

   the school subject `German' based on an observational system consisting
   of 25 subject specific and universal didactical criteria using 43
   videos. Against a backdrop of didactic conceptions, it is shown to what
   extent the two dimensions `social interaction' and `target orientation'
   can be theoretically described and empirically tested. The descriptive
   results indicate that writing lessons largely fulfil universal
   didactical quality criteria (e.g. precision). With respect to subject
   specific didactical criteria (e.g. integration of the student's
   experience realm) writing lessons show a lower quality.},

   We examine six videotaped readings of one specific picture book app,
   with a focus on the strategies used by teachers in early childhood
   education and care institutions to control children's access to the
   medium and the types of verbal engagement (about the story and about the
   medium) that are generated by these different strategies. We use
   qualitative and quantitative analysis of video data. A qualitative
   categorization of the readings reveals the strategies Show, Show \&
   Share, and Share. In analyzing the participants' verbal and multisensory
   engagement, we find that the Show strategy generates more utterances,
   especially about the story, as well as more time spent on dialogue.},

Abstract = {An expansive view of care is vital to understanding children's
   sense-making of their care experiences in early childhood education.
   Yet, scant literature explores how toddlers enact and express

   understandings, and co-author narratives, of care with teachers.
   Discussion focuses on video data from two studies that investigated
   infants', toddlers' and teachers' pedagogical relationships in New
   Zealand and Australian settings. Cultural-historical and co-authoring
   concepts supported analysis of toddlers' object-centred play and caring
   actions. Findings show that toddlers engage teachers in co-creating
   caring actions while enacting and expressing care with dolls. We argue
   that this collaborative, object-centred play enables toddlers to
   co-author meanings of, and identity as,the one-caring. Implications
   emphasize teachers' intentional role and joint-play actions in
   supporting toddlers' initiatives to co-author care play narratives and
   their identity asthe one-caring.},

Abstract = {Out-of-school learning programs can be a context for positive
   development and learning for children and youth. However, research
   points to potential racial and socioeconomic disparities, or opportunity
   gaps, in this context. In this study, we use survey and video data from
   106 staff across 30 out-of-school programs to examine how three
   features, staff, activities, and adult-child interactions, differ based
   on the racial and socioeconomic makeup of programs. We find that staff
   at programs serving children from low-income families on average have
   less experience and education. Also, programs serving children from
   African American and low-income families tend to offer more
   academic-focused activities. Finally, we found no differences in
   adult-child interaction quality across programs in the sample. Our
   findings suggest that a racial and socioeconomic opportunity gap may
   exist in the out-of-school context. This has implications for
   educational equity and the positive development of children that
   participate in this context.},

Title = {Newcomer object ownership negotiations when transitioning from home care

Journal = {EUROPEAN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION RESEARCH JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {AUG 24},
Abstract = {For those experiencing them, educational transitions include not only
   the present time but are embedded within institutions that precede and
   extend beyond the individuals. This article explores how, as an
   institutional space, the early childhood education and care (ECEC)
   setting is (re)produced within young children's encounters with others
   during a transition period. Video-recorded observations of three
   infant-toddlers' first months of attendance to an ECEC setting were
   analysed following analytic induction and video interaction analysis.
   Two examples illustrating object ownership negotiations are discussed.
   The results show that, in their encounters with others, newcomers
   actively contributed to (re)producing the ECEC setting by advancing
   their own understandings of objects and ownership, practicing their own
   ways of being with objects. Moreover, the results indicate that
   teachers' contributions strongly influenced the outcomes of the
   encounters and, consequently, the constitution of shared understandings
   of objects and object ownership within the ECEC setting.},

Journal = {EARLY YEARS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The advancement of inclusive education policies worldwide has given
   greater weight to social justice practices in educational settings.
   However, inclusion in preschools has received less attention from
   researchers. This article examines a 4-year-old child's participation in
   a mainstream preschool in Australia from a cultural-historical
   perspective. In particular, this study used the concept of secondary
   disability to analyse the data, and in this process identified a
   contradiction between the teacher's perceptions of the child's abilities
   and the teacher's reported understanding of the parent's perceptions of
   the child's abilities, which `clouded' the child's position within the
   preschool setting. Eight hours of video data were gathered across eight
   months. The findings indicate that understanding the child's personality
   and potential can operate as a `pedagogical password' for the teacher to
   enter on to the child's unique developmental trajectory. This paper
   argues that identifying the unique developmental pathway of the child is
   essential to reduce secondary disabilities.},

Title = {Sport motor competencies and the experience of social recognition among
   peers in physical education - a video-based study},
Journal = {PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Pages = {506-519},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Background: Being recognized as a competent and accepted member in the
   peer group is one of the most important basic human needs for children
   and youth. However, it is the peer group itself that decides which
   competencies are estimated and which are not, and through this process,
   a social order as well as peer power constellations is created.Purpose:
   This study aimed to determine if and how sport motor competencies are
   used as a criterion for the experience of recognition or non-recognition
   among peers in physical education (PE). Therefore, a mixed-method study
   was conducted.Data collection: The data set includes video data from six
   different school classes (a total of 59 video sequences) and 40
   video-stimulated recall interviews with children who experience
   non-recognition or with children who transmit non-recognition. In
   addition, sociograms were included, as well as PE teachers' ratings of
   their students' sport motor competencies.Findings: A correlation
   analysis shows that sport motor competencies and the sociometric
   position in the peer group are significantly intercorrelated (r=0.50,
   p0.01). But a gender-differentiated analysis reveals that this finding
   is only valid for boys in their boys' peer group (r=0.60, p0.01), not
   for girls in their girls' peer group. The analysis of the video data
   based on the sociogram, interview, and sport motor rating data as
   validation methods identifies three contexts in PE classes where
   children refer to sport motor competencies to transmit recognition or
   non-recognition: (1) Children with relatively better motor skills draw
   attention to children with relatively poor motor skills in a humiliating
   manner by using publicizing strategies. The motor deficits of the
   concerned children are obviously focused upon on the social stage of the
   class. (2) Sport motor accidents can commonly happen to anyone
   regardless of the sport motor competencies offering an opportunity for
   practices of differentiation: sport motor accidents of popular children
   are positively focused upon and celebrated, even in competitive
   situations, while sport motor accidents of unpopular children in
   competitive situations lead to publicly demonstrated anger and to the
   loss of their positions and functions. Children use these situations as
   an opportunity to demonstrate social networks and affiliation borders as
   they do in the third context. (3) The social validation of sport motor
   successes is not only the recognition of good performance of a
   classmate, but also the acknowledgment of being significant for the
   successful student, as successful students only accept the recognizing
   acts of selective classmates; social relationships are publicly
   demonstrated. In conclusion, sport motor competencies play an important
   role in the everyday struggles of children for recognition in their peer
   group.},

Title = {Designing interaction tasks in Second Life for Chinese as a foreign
   language learners: A preliminary exploration},
Journal = {AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {184-202},
Abstract = {The aims of this research were to develop guidelines for designing
   interaction tasks for learners of Chinese as a foreign language (CFL)
   and to investigate the attitudes of CFL learners toward a full CFL class
   in Second Life (SL). Three research questions were addressed in this
   research: (1) what are the attitudes of CFL learners toward the language
   learning tasks in SL? (2) what kinds of social interactions emerge from
   learning activities in a CFL class in SL? (3) how do those activities
   benefit CFL learners in the learning of Chinese in SL? Two studies were
   conducted to tackle these questions. The cognition, usage, and expansion
   (CUE) model was proposed based on the findings obtained from study 1 and
   then implemented and evaluated in study 2. The findings of study 2
   indicated that the activities run in the CUE model were effective at
   motivating CFL beginners and improving their oral communication and
   social interactions. Based on the video data analysis, three criteria
   were proposed for designing learning activities. Suggestions are also
   made for future research on CFL teaching/learning in SL.},

Abstract = {In some Western contexts, the pedagogical practices of teachers are to
   intentionally involve in play-based learning through sustained shared
   conversations to extend children's thinking (Meade, A., Williamson, J.,
   Stuart, M., Smorti, S., Robinson, L., \& Carroll-Lind, J. (2013).
   Adult-child sustained shared thinking: Who, how and when? Early
   Education, 53(Autumn/Winter), 7-12). In this study, video data of eight
   teachers interacting with four focus children during imaginative play
   and their interview data were gathered. Both Vygotsky's (2004) concept
   of imaginative play and Kravtsov and Kravtsova's (2010) concept of
   ``double subjectivity{''} were used to identify six different
   pedagogical positions taken by teachers in children's play. After
   analysing the video footage and teachers' interview data, it was evident
   that the participating teachers drew primarily upon these six different
   types of pedagogical positioning in play to intentionally teach
   children. Our analysis sought to determine whether the teachers were
   imagining concepts with the children or whether they were outside of the
   play. This paper argues that the teachers' pedagogical positioning is
   important for conceptualising teaching practice in Australia.},

   a Maya community},
Journal = {APPLIED DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 19},
Abstract = {Analyzing three sets of video data collected in one Maya community, we
   examined apprenticeship and learning of backstrap loom weaving over
   three generations spanning the years 1970 to 2012. Like many cultural
   groups, the Maya of Chiapas are experiencing rapid sociodemographic
   shifts. Three generations of girls (N = 134) were observed at their
   looms: in the 1970 subsistence economy; in the transition to a
   commercial economy in the 1990s; and in 2012, when the commercial
   economy required formal education. Multilevel models showed that
   intergenerational sociodemographic change - increased time in school,
   greater involvement in the money economy, and decreased family size -
   changed weaving apprenticeship, which, in turn, was related to changes
   in characteristics of learners. In 2012, weaving learners received more
   explanations, praise, and body instruction from their teachers.
   Learners, in turn, asked more questions. However, these changes came at
   a cost - the gradual loss of weaving as an everyday subsistence practice
   and art form. Tracing intergenerational change over three generations,
   this study makes a unique contribution to an understanding of cultural
   evolution.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {On the basis of Bandura's social cognitive theory, researchers often
   assume that a teachers' self-efficacy (TSE) will have a positive effect
   on teaching quality. However, the available empirical evidence is mixed.
   Building on previous research into TSE, we examined whether assessing
   class-/task-specific TSE gives a more accurate indication of the
   associations between TSE assessments and student-rated teaching quality.
   The analyses were based on the English sample of the Teaching and
   Learning International Survey (TALIS) Video Study. Mathematics teachers
   (N = 86) rated their self-efficacy beliefs using generalized
   task-specific TSE items and class-/task-specific TSE items. Their
   students (N = 1,930) rated the quality of teaching in their math class.
   Multilevel regression analyses revealed stronger associations between
   student-rated teaching quality and class-/task-specific TSE than
   generalized task-specific TSE. We discuss possible reasons for these
   results and outline the potential benefits of using class-specific
   assessments for future TSE research.},

Abstract = {The quality of curriculum resources and teaching practices can constrain

   investigates 18 classes that all used the same curriculum resources

   percentages to identify the interaction of quality dimensions, the
   enactment of given curriculum resources, and students' mathematical
   achievement (when controlling for mathematical preknowledge and language
   proficiency). Multilevel regression analysis revealed that three quality
   dimensions that can easily be supported by the curriculum resources
   (Mathematical Richness, Cognitive Demand, and Connecting Registers) were
   on a high level, and their variance had no additional interaction with
   students' achievement. In contrast, the 4 quality dimensions that were
   enacted in the teacher-student interaction with more variance (Agency,
   Equitable Access, Discursive Demand, and, in particular, Use of Student
   Contributions) had a significant additional impact on student
   achievement. These findings reveal important insights into the
   implementability of equitable instructional approaches.},

Title = {Exploration of peer leader verbal behaviors as they intervene with small
   groups in college general chemistry},
Journal = {CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {576-588},
Abstract = {Current literature has emphasized the lack of research into verbal
   behaviors of teachers as a barrier to understanding the effectiveness of
   instructional interventions. This study focuses on the verbal behaviors
   of peer leaders, who serve as de facto teachers in a college chemistry
   teaching reform based on cooperative learning. Video data obtained
   throughout a semester of General Chemistry I from two different peer
   leaders, each interacting with a different group of students, was
   subjected to two rounds of qualitative data analysis. First, Toulmin's
   argumentation scheme was used to characterize the arguments constructed
   by group members during peer leader intervention. Next, verbal behaviors
   exhibited by the peer leaders during intervention were examined.
   Findings of this study showed that peer leaders used an array of verbal
   behaviors to guide students to build chemistry knowledge, and that a
   relationship existed between student argument components and peer leader
   verbal behaviors, with data most frequently emerging in response to
   short questions from the peer leader, and warrants in response to
   probing and clarifying questions. The findings from this study have
   implications for professional development of teachers at all levels,
   specifically for demonstrating the interplay between group intervention
   strategies and student discourse within cooperative learning groups.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on an educational game titled Cellverse, a two-player
   cross-platform VR project intended to teach high school biology students
   about cell structure and function. In Cellverse, players work in pairs
   to explore a human lung cell and diagnose and treat a dangerous genetic
   disorder. Cellverse is being designed by the Collaborative Learning
   Environments in Virtual Reality (CLEVR) team, an interdisciplinary team
   consisting of game designers, educational researchers, and graduate and
   undergraduate students. Using a design-based research approach, we have
   enlisted the help of both subject matter experts and user testers to
   iteratively design and improve Cellverse. The objective of this paper is
   to share how user and expert feedback can inform and enhance the
   development of learning games. We describe how we gather and synthesize
   information to review and revise our game from in-game observations,
   semi-structured interviews, and video data. We discuss the input of
   subject matter experts, present feedback from our user testers, and
   describe how input from both parties influenced the design of Cellverse.
   Our results suggest that including feedback from both experts and users
   has provided information that can clarify gameplay, instruction, subject
   portrayal, narrative, and in-game goals.},

   influenced the effective use of learning time during the open phases of
   game-based learning We used a newly developed method for video- and
   audio analysis (German: MuVA), which allowed for reliable documentation
   of students' interactions during those phases. The two-step multiple
   regression model demonstrated that both the learner's and the learning
   partner's goal orientation explain significant parts of the variance: A
   high performance goal orientation impairs a student's effective use of
   learning time, while a high performance avoidance orientation has a
   positive impact on his or her effective use of learning time. Working
   with a partner who has a high learning goal orientation or a high work
   avoidance orientation increases a student's effective use of his or her
   learning time, while a high work avoidance orientation on the partner's
   side has the opposite effect. Cognitive skills did not influence the
   effective use of learning time.},

Abstract = {In order to alleviate bottlenecks such as the lack of professional
   teachers, inattention during training processes,and low effectiveness in
   concentration training, we have proposed an immersive human-robot
   interactive (HRI) game framework based on deep learning for children's
   concentration training and demonstrated its use through human-robot
   interactive games based on gesture recognition. The HRI game framework
   includes four functional modules: video data acquisition, image
   recognition modeling, a deep learning algorithm (YOLOv5), and
   information feedback. First, we built a gesture recognition model
   containing 10,000 pictures of children's gestures, using the YOLOv5
   algorithm. The average accuracy in recognition training was 98.7\%.
   Second, we recruited 120 children with attention deficits (aged from 9
   to 12 years) to play the HRI games, including 60 girls and 60 boys. In
   the HRI game experiment, we obtained 8640 sample data, which were
   normalized and processed.According to the results, we found that the
   girls had better visual short-term memory and a shorter response time
   than boys. The research results showed that HRI games had a high
   efficacy, convenience, and full freedom, making them appropriate for
   children's concentration training.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards have been developed to facilitate teacher
   guidance in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). As yet,
   little is known about how teachers interpret dashboard information to
   facilitate guidance in their teaching practice. This study examined
   teachers' behavior patterns in interpreting information from dashboards,
   and obtained their views about the potential barriers in interpreting
   dashboard information. Fourteen pre-service teachers participated in the
   study and data were collected from multiple sources. In total, 1,346 min
   of video data on teachers' guiding behavior and approximately 27,000
   words from a cued retrospective report and interview data were
   generated. A two-stage approach was adopted to process the data. Based
   on the video analysis in the first stage, we extracted teachers' four
   typical behavior patterns in finding and reading dashboard information
   and two behavior patterns when explaining information from dashboards.
   Thematic analysis at the second stage identified useful indicators for
   teacher guidance in CSCL and some major barriers teachers encountered in
   interpreting information. These findings may help improve the design of
   dashboards and show how teachers integrate dashboards into their daily
   teaching practice, thereby enhancing students' collaboration and
   learning.},

   Children's Spatial Thinking During Play},
Journal = {SAGE OPEN},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {With the decline in Australian school children's mathematics skills, the
   spotlight is shining on the quality of early childhood mathematics
   teaching and learning in the preschool years. Spatial thinking-which
   includes spatial orientation and spatial visualization-contributes to
   early mathematical thinking and children have the capacity to
   demonstrate abstract spatial concepts both verbally and nonverbally, yet
   may be overlooked in practice. This qualitative study analyses selected
   excerpts from a corpus of video data of 4- and 5-year-old children
   participating in a 6-week project designed to support children's spatial
   thinking skills. A conversation analytic approach is taken to
   demonstrate children's spatial thinking made visible through gesture and
   action. Showing how this is done by analyzing the verbal and nonverbal
   elements of back-and-forth interactions, with explicit attention to the
   ``how{''} of intentional teaching, reveals the interrelationship between
   learning and teaching. In addition, the critical role played by
   in-the-moment formative assessment of children's demonstrated spatial
   thinking and the maximization of opportunities for teachers to support
   concept acquisition are emphasized. The analysis of authentic
   interactions thus serves as a provocation for professional learning.},

   processing in cooperative group work},
Journal = {LEARNING CULTURE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the present study, video data was used to examine the effects of
   structuring procedures in cooperative learning on student teachers'
   interactions during group work. Using quantitative content analyses, we
   analyzed videos of students working on complex case-based tasks with
   regard to their active participation in the group discussions, use of
   conceptual knowledge and transactive communication during concept-based
   talk. In addition, we assessed students' individual case knowledge after
   they finished the group work. Two-level analyses revealed that student
   teachers in high-structure cooperative learning groups used more
   concept-driven ideas to solve the case than students in low-structure
   cooperative learning groups. They also referred to the ideas of other
   group members more often and externalized their ideas more without
   referring to each other. Students in high-structure cooperative learning
   groups gained more case-related knowledge than those in low-structure
   cooperative learning groups. No difference between conditions was
   detected for students' active participation in the group work. These
   findings indicate that emphasizing interdependence and accountability in
   cooperative groups might not increase the intensity of students' case
   discussion but does improve its quality.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the strategies elementary school students use to
   self-regulate their learning while in a hypermedia environment. This
   exploratory study investigated the self-regulatory strategies that young
   students (N = 48, M-age = 10.75) utilized while individually completing
   a 20-min online research task about space. Video data was coded using
   Azevedo et al.'s (2004) established coding scheme for analyzing
   self-regulatory behavior in hypermedia environments. Results showed that
   young students spent the majority of their time using cognitive
   strategies (M = 75.26\%) to read and summarise information to complete
   the task. Little time was taken to plan (M = 6.99\%) or monitor (M =
   5.92\%) their work or learning processes, which are key attributes of
   effective self-regulation. The study reveals the disparity between the
   ability to navigate within a hypermedia environment and utilizing
   planning and monitoring processes to enhance learning while using
   digital tools. This study highlights the need for the explicit teaching
   of planning and monitoring strategies in order for young students to
   develop the full range of self-regulation skills they need when using
   technology, for instance while learning from home during COVID-19.
   Implications for curriculum policy and teacher practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {Using video-elicitation focus group interviews, this study aims to
   reveal pre-service science teachers' perspectives and reasoning on
   artificial intelligence as a socioscientific issues-based scenario.
   Hence, it illustrates the ways the video data were used in the focus
   group elicitation interviews to understand their interpretations of how
   their beliefs align with a hypothetical future scenario around
   artificial intelligence. To demonstrate the phenomenon in depth, a case
   study design was used. The participants of the study involved 45 third
   and fourth-year undergraduate students enrolled in a science teacher
   education programme. For this study, the researcher conducted six
   open-ended, unstructured video-elicitation focus group interviews. The
   data was analysed using Dey's (1993. Qualitative data analysis: A
   user-friendly guide for social scientists. Routledge) qualitative
   analysis steps of description, qualification, and association. The
   findings indicated that the participants' views and reasoning vary in
   the context of artificial intelligence technologies. The fictional
   scenario depicted in the video-elicitation interviews both helped and
   challenged them to share their perspectives on the issue. Moreover,
   several aspects of SSI were thoroughly discussed during the interviews.},

Abstract = {In recent science education, experimentation features ever more strongly
   as a method of inquiry in science classes rather than as a means to
   illustrate phenomena. Ideas and materials to teach inquiry abound. Yet,
   tools for assessing students' achievement in their processes of
   experimentation are lacking. The present study assumes a basal,
   non-exclusive process model of inquiry in experimentation that can be
   considered a consensus from multiple approaches: (1) finding an
   idea/hypothesis, (2) planning and conducting an experiment, and (3)
   drawing conclusions from evidence. The study confronted 339 secondary
   level students with three guided inquiry experimentation tasks on 3
   days. Selected working groups were videotaped while experimenting. All
   the students reported their processes in a structured report form
   simultaneous to their progress. The generated videos and reports were
   analysed in a two-stepped way: (1) Experimentation was coded according
   to the process model into process plots; on basis of these, (2)
   process-focused performance scores were calculated considering logical
   coherence and immediacy of the inquiry processes. Correlative analyses
   show for two of the tasks that the report format yielded comparable
   performance scores to those generated from video data after students
   have had opportunity to learn the surveying formats (r(S)>.80). A first
   suggestion of a process-oriented assessment tool for inquiry in
   experimentation can be drawn from this study. It might be used to inform
   and complement secondary science instruction.},

Title = {A cultural-historical study of the development of emotion regulation
   through collective play in an institutional care setting in China},
Journal = {LEARNING CULTURE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {There has been a number of institution-based interventions aiming to
   tackle the adverse effect of orphanages on child development, but few
   have focused on the development of emotion regulation (ER). Conversely,
   research shows that early childhood is a critical time for ER
   development and imaginative play is an effective tool. Therefore, this
   paper aims to explore whether and how collective play can support ER
   development of the young orphanage children. Based on the
   cultural-historical theory of emotion and ER development, we implemented
   an educational experiment (Hedegaard, 2008b) of collective play for ten
   weeks in an orphan-care institution in China. Diandian (pseudonym), aged
   4.5 years, was observed as she expressed fear towards a ``scary{''}
   cleaner in her everyday life and participated in the collective play
   activities. 78 h of digital video data were collected and analysed. The
   findings demonstrate the process where the raw emotion of fear was made
   conscious through enacting and re-enacting play roles, which eventually
   led to Diandian's regulation of fear in play. We argue that even though
   an orphanage is not comparable to typical family settings, there are
   still possibilities for a dynamic social environment to be created for
   its children where ER development is supported pedagogically.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As photographic technologies continue to develop, so too do the social
   practices surrounding their use. The focus of this paper is on the
   social practices surrounding images captured from a new photographic
   device-SenseCam-which, rather than capturing individual images when
   triggered by the user, automatically captures a series of images. This
   paper is concerned with the use of SenseCam digital images in social
   contexts where there is a professional purpose-supporting the
   collaborative reflective practices of school teachers and university
   tutors as part of their professional development. Analysis of video data
   collected from 16 in-situ case studies of reflective discussions shows
   evidence that reflection took place as defined in the literature.
   Further the phototalk around SenseCam images was found to benefit
   reflection in these social situations through promotion of a rich shared
   understanding of the lesson context: supporting return to the
   experience, sharing of background context, grounding conversations,
   illustrating and providing evidence, and allowing people to see more.
   The paper concludes with a discussion on how different features of
   SenseCam images, such as variable quality, lack of audio and
   incompleteness, helped in this reflection or not. Finally implications
   from this work and participant's comments are used to suggest ways in
   which SenseCam may be used in the future in teachers' and tutors' social
   reflection. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The epistemological commitments of modes: opportunities and challenges
   for science learning},
Journal = {VISUAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 SEP 15},
Abstract = {Meaning making in science is supported by different modes, such as
   spoken and written language, images and gestures, all of which have
   different affordances. The epistemological commitments of modes are
   affordances that cannot be avoided. This article investigates how the
   epistemological commitments of modes affect possibilities for learning.
   Video data was collected from a learning activity where upper secondary
   students drew and explained an experiment representing the greenhouse
   effect. The analysis uses the variation theory of learning, which
   assumes that students learn when they notice new aspects of objects of
   learning by experiencing variation against an invariant background. Such
   variation can be created through the representations used. Findings show
   that, in the learning activity, variation was created in a range of
   modes. Some of the variation, particularly with regards to radiation,
   was due to the epistemological commitments of drawing. However, these
   aspects of radiation went unnoticed by the students, possibly because
   several aspects varied simultaneously. The teacher then helped the
   students to become aware of certain variation. Implications for the
   teaching and learning of science when taking the epistemological
   commitment of different modes into consideration include both
   challenges, such as when unintended variation is created, and
   opportunities, such as when spontaneously occurring variation can be
   taken up for discussion.},

Title = {Playful interventions to promote the subjective wellbeing of pediatric
   cancer inpatients during laboratory and imaging exams: A qualitative
   study},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY NURSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: We investigate the experience of pediatric oncology patients
   with objects and equipment involved in laboratory and image examinations
   during hospitalization for cancer treatment while generating guidelines
   for playful interventions to improve their subjective wellbeing.
   Method: The study was carried out at a public tertiary referral teaching
   hospital in Southern Brazil. Data collection was based on participatory
   observations with six children aged 4-8 years. Their experiences with
   exams were observed through pretend play and recorded in field diaries,
   audio, and video. Data were analyzed using Thematic Analysis and
   discussed according to the PERMA-V model, a theoretical framework from
   positive psychology.
   Results: Several objects and equipment that seem to affect the wellbeing
   of children during exams were identified. Four playful interventions
   were proposed as supportive care initiatives: use of technology to allow
   immersive experiences in learning about treatment and medical condition;
   design for personalization; gamifying experiences to allow positive
   reinforcement; and design for focus redirection.
   Conclusions: Guidelines for playful interventions to foster the
   subjective wellbeing of hospitalized children during image and
   laboratory exams were proposed. The PERMA-V model provided a solid base
   for the analysis of the interventions, which will be implemented and
   tested in future studies in clinical settings.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the process of instructional change required to
   translate data on student progress along learning trajectories (LTs)
   into relevant instructional modifications. Researchers conducted a
   professional development session on ratio LTs, which included analyzing
   3 years of district-level data from Math-Mapper 6-8, a digital LT-based
   diagnostic assessment application, with fifteen 6th and 7th grade
   teachers. Teachers subsequently conducted a lesson study to enact what
   they had learned, allowing researchers to study how teachers used data
   on student progress along ratio equivalence LTs to design, implement,
   and evaluate the lesson study. Researchers applied a framework for
   LT-based data-driven decision making to analyze video data of the lesson
   study activities. Teachers successfully scanned data reports to pinpoint
   the LT levels at which to target modified instruction. In one instance,
   they focused too narrowly on a single item resulting in excessive lesson
   time on tasks on graph literacy external to the LT. In the other, their
   data interpretation was overly general and resulted in the design and
   implementation of a sequence of tasks that reversed the order implied in
   the LT and relied on the use of more sophisticated strategies from
   subsequent LTs. Results suggest a need for more data interpretation
   skills, a deep understanding of the learning theory underpinning LTs,
   and more precision in teacher discourse around LTs.},

Abstract = {According to social referencing theory, cues peers take from positive
   and negative teacher behavior toward a student affect the student's peer
   liking and disliking status. The present study was the first to test the
   hypothesized mediation model connecting teacher behavior with peer
   liking and disliking status, via peer perceptions of teacher liking and
   disliking for the student. We used a longitudinal design and controlled
   for peer perceptions of student behavior. A sample of 1,420 5th-grade
   students (M-age = 10.60) from 56 classes completed sociometric
   questionnaires at 3 time points within 1 school year. At the first time
   point video data was also recorded, and teacher behavior toward specific
   students was coded. A multilevel path analysis showed that teachers did
   function as social referents for peer status but only through their
   negative behavior toward a student. Negative teacher behavior was
   associated with peer perceptions of the teacher's disliking for the
   student 3 months later, which in turn predicted peers' disliking of the
   student 6 months later. Findings suggest that teachers play a prominent
   role in peer relationships, particularly in peer disliking. For
   practice, this suggests that it may be important for teachers to refrain
   from openly negative behavior toward students, particularly those at
   risk of peer rejection.},

Journal = {ANESTHESIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {117},
Number = {4},
Pages = {772-779},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Anesthesiologists deliver large quantities of verbal
   information to patients during preoperative teaching. Basic principles
   of cognitive psychology dictate that much of this information is likely
   to be forgotten. Exactly how much and what type of information can be
   retained and recalled remains an open question.
   Methods: With Institutional Review Board approval, 98 healthy, educated
   volunteers viewed a brief video containing a preoperative explanation of
   anesthetic options and instructions. Subjects were then asked to engage
   in free and cued recall of information from the video, and to complete a
   recognition task. We developed a coding scheme to objectively score the
   free and cued recall tasks for the quantity of information recalled
   relative to the quantity presented in the video. Data are presented as
   descriptive statistics.
   Results: Subjects spontaneously recalled less than 25\% of the
   information presented. Providing retrieval cues greatly enhanced recall:
   Subjects recalled 67\%, on average, of the material queried in the cued
   recall task. Performance was even stronger on the multiple-choice test
   (83\% of items correctly answered), indicating that the information was
   initially encoded. The category of information that was consistently
   least-remembered was presurgical medication instructions.
   Conclusions: Under realistic conditions for recall, most medical
   instruction given to patients will not be recalled, even if it is
   initially encoded. Given the limits of short-term memory, clinicians
   should carefully consider their patterns of information giving.
   Improvement of memory performance with cues for retrieval indicates that
   providing printed instructions for later review may be beneficial.},

Title = {Educating science teachers in the twenty-first century: implications for

Abstract = {This study examines the verbal interactions among a group of pre-service
   teachers as they engaged in scientific discussions in a medicinal
   chemistry course. These discussions were part of the course that
   encompassed an explicit instruction of scientific argumentation
   structures as well as an applied component, whereby the pre-service
   teachers learned the content of medicinal chemistry through cases
   developed using the strategy of competing theories. By adopting a case
   study approach using sociocultural framework of learning, we examined
   the interactions between the pre-service teachers using video data. We
   describe 12 possible forms of interactions during discussions - (1)
   seeking clarification, (2) figuring out loud, (3) sharing information,
   (4) agreement, (5) asking questions, (6) providing explanations, (7)
   raising strategic and procedural issues, (8) stating claims, (9)
   disagreement, (10) sharing perspectives, (11) offering alternatives, and
   (12) persuasion. The pre-service teachers engaged in figuring out aloud
   and seeking clarifications frequently, and used persuasion least in
   their discussions. To clarify their ideas and thoughts, pre-service
   teachers commonly rebut their counterparts and used warrants to support
   their own assertions. A similar pattern was also observed when figuring
   their thoughts out loud. Our findings suggest that pre-service teachers
   were able to carry out rebuttals in the argumentation process. However,
   the quality and function of their rebuttals can be improved by deepening
   their understanding of the subject matter knowledge and the science
   argumentation structure. Implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {The following article examines the feedback-behavior of elementary
   school teachers as a component of deep-structure in first grade lessons.
   The paper investigates the frequency and forms of teacher-given feedback
   to pupils during a class work period. The focus lies on a period while
   pupils were engaged in fulfilling a writing task (producing texts).
   Furthermore, the distribution of feedback on the pupils is considered.
   The impact of specific forms of feedback towards the quality of the
   texts produced by pupils is a subject of interest, too. The present
   analyses emerge from the DFG-project NaSch1 ({''}Narrative
   Schreibkompetenz in Klasse 1{''}) and are based on video data captured
   in the PERLE study. All in all, the video corpus comprises 47 recorded
   lesson-units with an approximate length of 90 \& x202f;min. each and a
   total sample of 540 first-grade pupils. The overall results indicate
   significant differences in teachers' feedback-behavior. Elaborated
   feedback (such as ``tutorial support{''}) occurs less frequently than
   basic forms of feedback. Also, there is a tendency for boys to receive
   more feedback overall. Another finding is that the initiative to provide
   feedback originates more frequently from pupils than from teachers.
   Multilevel analysis on the impact of feedback towards text-quality
   reveal no significant effects for elaborated feedback. A negative
   correlation between the feedback on the writing content and the
   linguistic dimension of the text quality are recognized.},

Abstract = {This study contributes to our understanding of meaning making in CSCL
   environments by examining a specific aspect of collaborative problem
   solving in which students improvise, introduce, and make meaning with
   representations in disciplinary domains. These situations include the
   embodied and imaginative processes of discovering new representational
   possibilities and artifact meanings. Much of the research on
   student-generated representations examines situations in which students
   are asked by a teacher or researcher explicitly to produce
   representations. However, we need more knowledge about how students
   within CSCL settings introduce representations from outside of the
   designed environment or intended task in order to solve a problem. To
   unpack the processes of collaborative improvisation and meaning making,
   we take a sociocultural stance towards imagining. This stance involves
   considering the socially and materially situated ways that participants
   express new possibilities and alternative situations that extend beyond
   the present reality. Focusing on a specific task based on maps as
   disciplinary representations, we analyze video data of upper secondary
   physics students working in small groups in a co-located CSCL
   environment. To characterize shifts across boundaries of several
   modalities including the verbal and gestural, digital and physical, and
   2-dimensional and 3-dimensional, we identify emergent representations as
   imaginative productions. The findings extend current research on
   collaborative meaning making by bringing attention to the processes
   through which improvised representations emerge.. This knowledge is key
   to facilitating the discovery of representational possibilities in CSCL
   environments.},

Abstract = {Giving students opportunities to work collaboratively with complex
   online information is important for the development of democratic
   citizenship, but providing and structuring these opportunities poses
   pedagogical challenges. In this study, we investigate how digital
   mapping tools developed within Science and Technology Studies (STS) are
   used by upper secondary science students for the collaborative
   exploration and ordering of controversial socio-scientific issues (SSIs)
   found online. Our sociocultural approach to detailed analysis of video
   data reveals how students synchronously construct shared interactive
   visualizations and respond collaboratively to mediating features of the
   network visualization tool for handling multiple perspectives and
   information encountered online. The analysis shows how the tool-mediated
   activity provided means for students to work out what is relevant and
   useful in a corpus of online data. We unpack the details of the complex
   dynamics of this process of evaluating and categorizing websites,
   uncovering ways that interaction with emerging knowledge artefacts is
   co-constitutive of participation in the local setting. In particular,
   this analysis reveals how the tool-mediating activity slows down the
   process of judging and categorizing online material in terms of criteria
   such as institutional status, trustworthiness, and position of a
   controversy. Furthermore, it reveals that alignments and misalignments
   between the digital tool used and students' own logics prompted students
   to engage in productive collaborative negotiation of how to make sense
   of a controversy.},

Abstract = {Although much research exists on scaffolding in reading instruction,
   confusion about the construct persists. In this commentary inspired by a
   recent article in Reading Research Quarterly, we argue for the
   importance of contingencythat is, responsiveness to student thinkingin
   reading comprehension scaffolding. We begin by defining two sometimes
   nebulous constructs: scaffolding and comprehension. We then argue that
   the dynamic, contextual, and affective nature of comprehension calls for
   a focus on contingency in scaffolding interactions because the requisite
   assumptions of preplanned scaffolding can obscure students' emergent
   comprehension. To focus on contingency, three implications for research
   follow. First, research designs could separate interactional scaffolding
   from planned scaffolding so as to directly investigate the construct.
   Second, collaboratively analyzing video data of scaffolding interactions
   is an effective tool for teacher educators and researchers. Finally,
   researchers should consider refining, building on, or comparing their
   findings with existing frameworks to illuminate both the transferable
   and the idiosyncratic dimensions of contingent scaffolding. This could
   also include studying students' discursive moves in addition to
   teachers' utterances, which might offer a new lens on how teachers
   adjust scaffolds in moment-to-moment interactions. These implications
   lay a foundation for a research agenda that goes beyond assumptions
   about students built into planned scaffolding and tackles the challenges
   of contingent comprehension scaffolding.},

Title = {How doctors make themselves understood in primary care consultations: A
   mixed methods analysis of video data applying health literacy universal
   precautions},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {Purpose
   To mitigate the health risks that result from low health literacy and
   difficulty identifying patients with insufficient health literacy,
   health organizations recommend physicians apply health literacy
   universal precaution communication skills when communicating with all
   patients. Our aim was to assess how health literacy universal
   precautions are delivered in routine GP consultations, and explore
   whether there were differences in how GPs used universal precaution
   approaches according to areas of deprivation in England.
   Methods
   This was a mixed methods study using video and interview data. Ten
   physicians conducted 217 consultations in primary care settings with
   adults over 50 years old between July 2017 and March 2018 in England.
   Eighty consultations (N = 80) met the inclusion criteria of new or
   persisting problems. Descriptive quantitative analysis of video-recorded
   consultations using an observation tool and qualitative thematic
   analysis of transcribed scripts. Metathemes explored differences in
   physicians' communication by areas of deprivation.
   Results
   Descriptive statistics showed physicians used a caring tone of voice and
   attitude (n = 73, 91.3\%) and displayed comfortable body language (n =
   69, 86.3\%) but infrequently demonstrated profession-specific health
   literacy universal precaution communication skills, such as the
   teach-back technique (n = 3, 3.8\%). Inferences about physicians'
   communication from qualitative analysis converged with the quantitative
   findings. Differences in physicians' communication varied according to
   areas of deprivation.
   Conclusions
   Physicians need health literacy universal precautions communication
   skills to improve population health.},

Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {31},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative (BFHI) is the global standard for
   maternity and community services requiring all practitioners to be
   trained to support mothers in the essential skills of supporting
   positioning and attachment, and hand expression. These studies aim to
   rigorously assess knowledge in nurses, midwives, and doctors in these
   skills, tested before and after watching short videos demonstrating
   these skills. Practitioners were attending BFHI education, and the video
   study was additional. In Phase 1 clinicians in England were randomised
   to one of two videos (practitioner role play or clinical demonstration).
   The results showed improvements in knowledge and confidence, and a
   preference for clinical demonstration by mothers and infants. The
   clinical demonstration video was evaluated in China in Phase 2 where
   expert trainers viewed the video after completing the BHFI workshop, and
   in Phase 3 practitioners viewed the video before the BHFI workshop.
   Phase 2 with expert trainers only showed improvement in knowledge of

Abstract = {This article focuses on the use of Toulmin's argumentation scheme to
   investigate the characteristics of student group argumentation in
   Peer-Led Guided Inquiry sessions for a General Chemistry I course. A
   coding scheme based on Toulmin's {[}Toulmin {[}1958] The uses of
   argument. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press] argumentation model was
   used for identifying arguments during group work without instructor
   intervention. A modification of the framework developed by Erduran et
   al. {[}Erduran, Simon, \& Osborne {[}2004] Science Education, 88(6),
   915-933] for characterizing arguments was employed that considered both
   the strength of the argument and whether an argument contained
   contributions from one or more than one student. Data were collected by
   video recording weekly peer-led sessions with a focus on two small
   groups. Analysis of this video data with the coding scheme and the
   framework revealed that students were mostly engaged in co-constructed
   arguments, with more than one student providing evidence and reasoning
   during group activities. Students often supported their claims with data
   and warrants but rarely offered backings. That is, they supported their
   answers with evidence and reasoning but did not often elaborate on their
   reasoning or further validate their explanations. However, the
   percentage of arguments containing backings increased when arguments
   contained contributions from more than one student rather than being
   presented by one individual. Another significant finding is that
   students were able to resolve wrong claims through argumentation without
   peer leader intervention, an indication of independent learning. (c)

Abstract = {All scientists depend on both reading and writing to do their scientific
   work. It is of paramount importance to ensure that students have a
   relevant repertoire of practices they can employ when facing scientific
   content inside and outside the school context. The present study reports
   on students in seventh grade acting as researchers. Over an 8-week
   collaborative research period, students posed their own research
   question, attempted to answer it by systematically testing hypotheses,
   discussing findings, presenting their conclusions, and documenting their
   process in a written report. Drawing on the perspectives of New Literacy
   Studieswhich sees literacy as socially situatedwe analyze the purpose of
   all the 21 participating students' texts (n=344). Video observations and
   interviews with students are used to contextualize the writing events.
   We find that the students chose to write multiple kinds of texts for a
   variety of purposes. Analyzing purpose and the context, three stages of
   socialization into scientific writing is revealed, ranging from what the
   students write on their own initiative, via texts written through
   challenges to demanding research tasks scaffolded through writing
   instructions given by the teacher. Further, the students emphasized the
   relevance of both the research experience and the writing to their
   future adult life.},

Title = {Exploring the relationships between teacher noticing, ambisonic audio,
   and variance in focus when viewing 360 video},
Journal = {ETR\&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {71},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A growing body of research has supported the implementation of
   innovative and immersive video for teaching and learning across the
   lifespan. Immersive video, delivered through eXtended Reality (XR) tools
   like 360 video, provides users with new ways to see real or created
   environments. Unfortunately, most of the existing research has
   highlighted immersive video without accompanying immersive audio. This
   use of monophonic audio can create a disconnect for viewers as they
   experience close to real world video with sounds that do not match a
   real-world environment. The purpose of this study was to respond to this
   gap in the literature by exploring the use of ambisonic audio and its
   impact on preservice teacher noticing and variability of viewing focus
   when watching 360 video. Data were collected from undergraduate teacher
   education students who participated in a self-paced online activity that
   included watching 360 videos and responding to a questionnaire. A
   convergent mixed methods design was employed to compare participants'
   professional noticing and observed viewing behavior in the context of
   ambisonic and monophonic audio. Results showed that users in ambisonic
   audio conditions in 360 video environments were more likely to have
   higher focus. Moreover, for users who had specific professional
   knowledge, monophonic audio with immersive video had a negative impact
   on their variance in focus. The paper concludes with recommendations for
   future research on the use of audio in virtual and augmented reality
   environments.},

Title = {Investigating learners' engagement and science learning outcomes in
   different designs of participatory simulated games},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1197-1214},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the affordances of
   participatory simulations by comparing students' models of engagement
   and science learning outcomes in a multi-team participatory simulated
   game (MPSG) and a single-team participatory simulated game (SPSG). Two
   versions of a mobile-based game about marine fishery management were
   created. Participants were 105 seventh-grade students in Taiwan.
   Research instruments included a Science Game Engagement questionnaire
   and a Marine Ecosystem and Sustainability Test. Students' interviews and
   classroom videos were also collected. Students' models of engagement
   were analyzed by using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation
   Modeling, and comparisons of subscales of engagement and learning
   outcomes were made by Analysis of Covariance statistics. The results
   showed that the students in the MPSG group had a higher level of
   behavioral engagement and better learning achievement than the students
   in the SPSG group did. Also, in exploring the interrelationships among
   the subscales of students' engagement, we found that, in the SPSG group,
   students' behavioral engagement was positively predicted by their
   emotional engagement, while in the MPSG group, it was positively
   predicted by their social engagement. In both groups, behavioral
   engagement predicted cognitive engagement. This finding was supported by
   the video data in that more interactions among the group members were
   observed in the MPSG group. This indicated that the multi-agent, dynamic
   modeling in the MPSG may have shifted the quality of the learners'
   social interactions. The affordances of participatory simulated games
   are discussed, and future research directions are provided.
   Practitioner notes
   What is already known about this topic
   Participatory simulations allow users to participate in simulations by
   controlling one of the roles in the system which models real-life
   settings. Dynamic modeling is an essential feature of participatory
   simulations that allows the learners to see the exact impact of their
   participation on changes in the system.
   Students who learned with the participatory simulations showed
   significantly better reasoning in concept building and fewer
   misconceptions than with conventional simulations.
   However learners can overly emphasize racing to win in multi-agent
   participatory simulations and tasks in participatory simulations can be
   too challenging for some learners.
   What this paper adds
   We compared students' engagement models in two versions of a
   participatory game-a multi-team participatory simulated game (MPSG) and
   a single-team participatory simulated game (SPSG). We found that in the
   MPSG social engagement predicted behavioral engagement while in the SPSG
   students' emotional engagement played an important role.
   Students who participated in the MPSG had better performance in system
   thinking than the students in the SPSG.
   Implications for practice and/or policy
   Dynamic modeling is not only authentic for simulating certain scientific
   phenomena but also it offers the affordances of improving the quality of
   learners' social interactions. This should be taken into account in the
   future design of educational simulations.
   A multi-team design of participatory simulation taking advantage of
   competition among teams and collaboration within teams can help students
   to learn complex phenomena.},

Abstract = {Objective: To identify the decision-making process involved in
   determining when to intervene, where to deliver and the optimal choice
   of instrument for operative vaginal deliveries in the second stage of
   labour.
   Study design: A qualitative study using interviews and video recordings
   took place at two university teaching hospitals (St. Michael's Hospital
   Bristol and Ninewells Hospital, Dundee). Ten obstetricians and eight
   midwives were identified as experts in conducting or supporting
   operative vaginal deliveries. Semi-structured interviews were carried
   out using routine clinical scenarios. The experts were also video
   recorded conducting low cavity vacuum and mid-cavity rotational forceps
   deliveries in a simulation setting. The interviews and video recordings
   were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic coding. The
   anonymised data were independently coded by three researchers and then
   compared for consistency of interpretation. The experts reviewed the
   coded interview and video data for respondent validation and
   clarification. The themes that emerged following the final coding were
   used to identify the decision-making process when planning and
   conducting an operative vaginal delivery. Key decision points were
   reported in selecting when and where to conduct an operative vaginal
   delivery and which instrument to use.
   Results: The final decision-making list highlights the various decision
   points to consider when performing an operative vaginal delivery. We
   identified clinical factors that experts take into consideration when
   selecting where the delivery should take place and the preferred choice
   of instrument.
   Conclusion: This detailed illustration of the decision-making process
   could aid trainees' understanding of the approach to safe operative
   vaginal delivery, aiming to minimise morbidity. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Toddlers as active, competent story weavers: Lexie's story},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD LITERACY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 NOV 12},
Abstract = {Communication and literacy development of young children is shaped by
   the nature of social and cultural relationships in everyday situations.
   Few studies, however, have explored early story experiences encountered
   by infants and toddlers in naturalistic settings. We argue that personal
   stories about everyday lived experiences are a vital context for
   considering how toddlers develop communicative competencies as they
   participate in these stories within their families and communities. The
   paper presents selected findings from a qualitative study underpinned by
   a broad theoretical view of story embedded in a sociocultural,
   participatory framework. We contend that stories are collaborative,
   social endeavours in which intersubjectivity is accomplished
   collectively and multimodally. Evidence is offered of the communicative
   process enacted by 1-year-old Lexie, her parent, teacher and peers, as
   they shared meaning together in a personal story about eating lunch.
   Lexie and her family were participants in a wider study of the story
   experiences of 1-year-old toddlers, within and across their family home
   and early childhood settings, in a culturally diverse community of
   Aotearoa New Zealand. Drawing on multimodal ethnography and video data,
   findings illustrate how Lexie and her family, teacher and peers actively
   participated together in the weaving of a shared personal story using
   verbal, visual and kinaesthetic forms of communication. The study
   contributes to the field of early childhood literacy by providing unique
   insights into the potential of everyday personal stories as a valuable
   context for exploring ways children's communicative competencies are
   developed through relationships in family and community settings.},

Title = {Studying Students' Learning Processes Used during Physics Teaching
   Sequence about Gas with Networks of Ideas and Their Domain of
   Applicability},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {223-249},
Abstract = {In literature, several processes have been suggested to describe
   conceptual changes being undertaken. However, a few parts of studies
   analyse in great detail which students' learning processes are involved
   in physics classes during teaching, and how they are used. Following a
   socio-constructivist approach using tools coming from discourse
   analysis, we suggest studying three processes of students' learning: (1)
   establishing links between ideas, (2) increasing the domain of
   applicability of ideas, or (3) decreasing the domain of applicability of
   ideas. Our database consists of video data and written worksheets of two
   students at the upper-secondary school level (Grade 10 {[}15-year-old
   students]) during a one-month teaching sequence about gas. Based on
   semiotic resources contained in oral and written language, we
   reconstruct in great detail all the ideas about gas expressed by both
   students during the entire teaching sequence. Our analysis deals with
   (1) how learning processes are identified based on the ideas expressed
   by students, and (2) how the three learning processes are used by the
   two students during teaching. Our results show that during the teaching
   sequence: (1) the emergence of the networks of three ideas is supported
   by networks of two ideas expressed previously by students; (2) both
   students express more networks of two ideas than networks of three
   ideas; (3) the process `increasing the domain of applicability' of an
   idea or a network of ideas is very often involved; and (4) the process
   `decreasing the domain of applicability' of an idea or network of ideas
   is rarely used by them.},

Title = {Visual research in clinical education},
Journal = {MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {105-113},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {AimThe aim of this paper is to explore what might be gained from
   collecting and analysing visual data, such as photographs, scans,
   drawings, video and screen recordings, in clinical educational research.
   Its focus is on visual research that looks at teaching and learning as
   it naturally occurs' in the work place, in simulation centres and other
   sites, and also involves the collection and analysis of visual learning
   materials circulating in these sites.
   BackgroundWith the ubiquity of digital recording devices, video data and
   visual learning materials are now relatively cheap to collect. Compared
   to other domains of education research visual materials are not widely
   used in clinical education research. The paper sets out to identify and
   reflect on the possibilities for visual research using examples from an
   ethnographic study on surgical and inter-professional learning in the
   operating theatres of a London hospital.
   Main contributionThe paper shows how visual research enables
   recognition, analysis and critical evaluation of (1) the hidden
   curriculum, such as the meanings implied by embodied, visible actions of
   clinicians; (2) the ways in which clinical teachers design multimodal
   learning environments using a range of modes of communication available
   to them, combining, for instance, gesture and speech; (3) the informal
   assessment of clinical skills, and the intricate relation between
   trainee performance and supervisor feedback; (4) the potentialities and
   limitations of different visual learning materials, such as textbooks
   and videos, for representing medical knowledge.
   Discussion and conclusionThe paper concludes with theoretical and
   methodological reflections on what can be made visible, and therefore
   available for analysis, explanation and evaluation if visual materials
   are used for clinical education research, and what remains unaccounted
   for if written language remains the dominant mode in the research cycle.
   Opportunities for quantitative analysis and ethical implications are
   also discussed.},

Title = {Student Self-Assessment and Faculty Assessment of Performance in an
   Interprofessional Error Disclosure Simulation Training Program},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {81},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Objectives. To conduct a prospective evaluation for effectiveness of an
   error disclosure assessment tool and video recordings to enhance student
   learning and metacognitive skills while assessing the IPEC competencies.
   Design. The instruments for assessing performance (planning,
   communication, process, and team dynamics) in interprofessional error
   disclosure were developed. Student self-assessment of performance before
   and after viewing the recordings of their encounters were obtained.
   Faculty used a similar instrument to conduct real-time assessments. An
   instrument to assess achievement of the Interprofessional Education
   Collaborative (IPEC) core competencies was developed. Qualitative data
   was reviewed to determine student and faculty perceptions of the
   simulation.
   Assessment. The interprofessional simulation training involved a total
   of 233 students (50 dental, 109 nursing and 74 pharmacy). Use of video
   recordings made a significant difference in student self assessment for
   communication and process categories of error disclosure. No differences
   in student self-assessments were noted among the different professions.
   There were differences among the family member affects for planning and
   communication for both pre-video and post-video data. There were
   significant differences between student self-assessment and faculty
   assessment for all paired comparisons, except communication in student
   post-video self-assessment. Students' perceptions of achievement of the
   IPEC core competencies were positive.
   Conclusion. The use of assessment instruments and video recordings may
   have enhanced students' metacognitive skills for assessing performance
   in interprofessional error disclosure. The simulation training was
   effective in enhancing perceptions on achievement of IPEC core
   competencies. This enhanced assessment process appeared to enhance
   learning about the skills needed for interprofessional error disclosure.},

Title = {``Anything taking shape?{''} Capturing various layers of small group
   collaborative problem solving in an experiential geometry course in
   initial teacher education},

Abstract = {Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is widely recognized as a prominent
   21st-century skill to be mastered. Until recently, research on CPS has
   often focused on problem solution by the individual; the interest in
   investigating how the theorized problem-solving constructs function as
   broader social units, such as pairs or small groups, is relatively
   recent. Capturing the complexity of CPS processes in group-level
   interaction is challenging. Therefore, a method of analysis capturing
   various layers of CPS was developed that aimed for a deeper
   understanding of CPS as a small-group enactment. In the study, small
   groups of teacher education students worked on two variations of
   open-ended CPS tasks-a technology-enhanced task and a task using
   physical objects. The method, relying on video data, encompassed
   triangulation of analysis methods and combined the following: (a)
   directed content analysis of the actualized CPS in groups, (b) process
   analysis and visualizations, and (c) qualitative cases. Content analysis
   did not show a large variation in how CPS was actualized in the groups
   or tasks for either case, whereas process analysis revealed both group-
   and task-related differences in accordance with the interchange of CPS
   elements. The qualitative cases exemplified the interaction diversity in
   the quality of coordination and students' equal participation in groups.
   It was concluded that combining different methods gives access to
   various layers of CPS; moreover, it can contribute to a deeper
   articulation of the CPS as a group-level construct, providing divergent
   ways to understand CPS in this context.},

Title = {Patients' attitudes towards patient involvement in safety interventions:
   results of two exploratory studies},
Journal = {HEALTH EXPECTATIONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {E164-E176},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background In recent years, patient-focused interventions have been
   introduced aimed at increasing patient involvement in safety-related
   behaviours. However, patients' attitudes towards these interventions and
   comfort in participating in the recommended behaviours remain largely
   unexplored. Objective To evaluate patients' attitudes towards a video
   and leaflet aimed at encouraging patient involvement in safety-related
   behaviours. Design Two exploratory studies employing a within-subjects
   mixed-methods design. Setting Six hospital wards on an inner-city London
   teaching hospital. Participants Medical and surgical inpatients: 80
   patients in study 1 (mean age 55; 69\% men) and 80 patients in study 2
   (mean age 52; 60\% men). Intervention Patients watched the PINK patient
   safety video (study 1) or read the National Patient Safety Agency's
   Please Ask' about staying in hospital leaflet (study 2). Main outcome
   measures Perceived comfort in participating in safety-related
   behaviours; attitudes towards the video or leaflet. Results Both video
   and leaflet increased patients' perceived comfort in engaging in some
   (but not all) safety-related behaviours (P<0.05). In both studies, the
   majority of patients questioned whether the intervention could help to
   reduce medical errors in health care. Suggestions on how the
   video/leaflet could be improved mainly related to content and layout.
   Conclusion Video and leaflet could be effective at encouraging patient
   involvement in some safety-related behaviours. Further in-depth research
   on patients' attitudes towards different educational materials is
   required to help inform future policies and interventions in this very
   important but under-researched area.},

Title = {What does it mean? Students' procedural and conceptual problem solving
   in a CSCL environment designed within the field of science education},

Abstract = {This article discusses the relationship between procedural and
   conceptual problem solving in a computer-supported collaborative
   learning (CSCL) environment designed within the field of science
   education. The contribution of this article, and our understanding of
   this phenomenon, is anchored in our socio-cultural interpretation, and
   that implies distinctive inputs for the design and re-design of these
   kinds of learning environments. We discuss institutional aspects linked
   to the school as a curriculum deliverer, as well as to the presentation
   of the knowledge domain and the construction of the CSCL environment.
   The data is gathered from a design experiment in a science setting in a
   secondary school, and video data is used to perform an interaction
   analysis. More specifically, we follow a group of four secondary school
   students who solve a biological problem in a computer-based 3D model
   supported by a website. Our findings are clear in the sense that the
   procedural types of problem solving tend to dominate the students'
   interactions, while conceptual knowledge construction is only present
   where it is strictly necessary to carry out the problem solving. Based
   on our analyses, we conclude that this can be explained partly by how
   the knowledge domain is presented and how the CSCL environment is
   designed, but that the main reason is linked to the institutional
   aspects related to the school as curriculum deliverer where its target
   is to secure that the students actually solve problems that are
   predefined in the syllabus list. We argue that this affords some
   particular challenges, linked to making conceptual knowledge
   constructions in science education explicit in the CSCL environment, and
   to encouraging the teachers and the school as a curriculum deliverer to
   give this kind of knowledge construction a prioritised value.},

Journal = {ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {395-419},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {Purpose This research investigated the reuse of Video Records of
   Practice (VRPs) - i.e. a type of qualitative data documenting teaching
   and learning in educational settings. It studied how reusers' purposes
   and experience-level with VRP reuse influence the importance of various
   VRP selection criteria and how these differ depending on whether the
   main goal for reuse was research or teaching. It also examined whether
   two different dimensions of qualitative research - reflexivity and
   context - were factors in VRP reuse. Design/methodology/approach The
   study reports on surveys of reusers at four VRP repositories. Questions
   were based on the literature and interviews with VRP reusers. The
   response rate was 20.6\% (180 of 872 distributed surveys). This paper
   focused on 126 respondents who affirmatively responded they reused VRPs
   from a repository. Findings Researchers using VRPs were primarily
   interested in examining a broad range of processes in education and
   studying/improving ways to measure differences and growth in education.
   Reusers with teaching goals were commonly interested in VRPs to engage
   learners in showing examples/exemplars of - and reflecting on - teaching
   and learning. These differences between research and teaching led to
   varied expectations about VRPs, such as the amount of content needed and
   necessary contextual information to support reuse. Research
   limitations/implications While repositories focus on exposing content,
   understanding and communicating certain qualities of that content can
   help reusers identify VRPs and align goals with selection decisions.
   Originality/value Although qualitative data are increasingly reused,
   research has rarely focused on identifying how qualitative data reusers
   employ selection criteria. This study focused on VRPs as one type of
   qualitative data and identified the attributes of VRPs that reusers
   perceived to be important during selection. These will help VRP
   repositories determine which metadata and documentation meet reusers'
   goals.},

Title = {What Happens Before Book Reading Starts? an Analysis of Teacher-Child
   Behaviours With Print and Digital Books},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {NOV 12},
Abstract = {A body of research documents teacher-child reading behaviors in
   educational settings. Few will disagree that the potential for word and
   narrative comprehension increases when children's prior knowledge is
   activated and when children's focus is fully on the reading session.
   Despite this, little is known about the potential for establishment of
   joint attention and activation of prior knowledge in an early childhood
   education and care setting and how early childhood educators prepare
   young children to participate in shared book reading sessions before
   formal reading starts. Based on video data of teachers (N = 12) and
   small groups of children (N = 72) reading picture books and picture book
   apps in kindergarten, we sought to shed light on what behaviors occur
   before reading starts. The analyses were conducted in two phases. The
   first phase was based on 48 videotaped readings and followed a
   descriptive quantitative approach to investigate early childhood
   teachers' time use before the reading session, with readings of both
   print books and picture book apps. The second phase was based on two app
   readings in which the pre-reading phases stood out for their long
   duration. A qualitative analytical approach was applied to describe the
   teacher-child behavior, establishment of joint attention, and activation
   of prior knowledge during the two specific pre-reading events. Even
   though the sample is small, we find clear examples of pre-reading
   strategies specific to app readings. In this study, we discuss teachers'
   strategies to promote joint attention and activation of prior knowledge
   in new ways and how teachers exploit the pre-reading phase, for instance
   taking advantage of the books paratext, while adapting to the medium.
   Nevertheless, there remains a knowledge gap concerning app readings with
   short or no pre-reading phases.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to examine the effects of a physical education teacher
   education programme on (a) preservice teachers' (PSTs') specialised
   content knowledge (SCK), and (b) the game-play development of their
   students, during a student-centred Sport Education-Step Game Approach
   (SE-SGA) unit. Three PSTs selected by convenience sampling (22-24 years
   old), their 60 eighth-grade students (three classes: 38 boys, 22 girls,
   M-age = 13.3), and a mentoring team (one teacher educator, one
   university supervisor, and one cooperating teacher) participated in the
   study. The PSTs participated in a two-stage programme where they learned
   how to teach volleyball using SE-SGA, and then implemented an SE-SGA
   unit during their school placement. Using audio/video data from 30
   lessons, we examined PSTs' SCK (content development, depth of content
   knowledge) on a lesson-by-lesson basis. We also assessed the 2v2
   game-play performance of PSTs' students across three assessment points.
   Descriptive statistics were computed for SCK scores and repeated
   measures analysis of variances were used to analyse variance in
   game-play variables over time. Results showed improvement in PSTs' SCK
   and students' game-play. The PSTs showed strong SCK, with index levels
   above the 3.0 cut point, and progressive use of informing, refining, and
   applying-game tasks over time. Students improved in most game-play
   variables (namely `serve', `reception', `setting') and the `game
   performance index' over time. Student game-play development seemed to be
   strongly influenced by an interdependent interaction between PSTs' SCK
   and additional situated, model-based features of content development
   (i.e. extensive application of knowledge in competition events, the
   problem-solving focus of the refining tasks).},

Title = {Use of technical terms in German biology lessons and its effects on

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Educational standards and instructional frameworks aim to foster
   students' scientific literacy, especially their conceptual knowledge.
   Previous research has examined several instructional approaches to
   foster students' conceptual learning. Reliable and adequate use of
   technical terms in science instruction is also essential for fostering
   students' conceptual learning. However, current studies of the analyses
   of the use of technical terms and their effects on fostering students'
   conceptual understanding in biology lessons are lacking. In this study,
   we first conducted a descriptive analysis of the technical terms used in
   selected videotaped German 9(th)-grade biology lessons (N = 43) on
   neurobiology. Then, we conducted multilevel analyses of the effects of
   using different technical terms in a biology lesson on students'
   achievement and situational interest. Our descriptive results showed
   that on average teachers (N = 43) talked more and used more technical
   terms compared to their students and that many different technical terms
   were used in our analysed lessons. Furthermore, our multilevel analyses
   showed negative effects of using a high number of different technical
   terms on both student outcome variables. We conclude that a
   well-considered, but simple, reduction of technical terms in biology
   lessons could positively affect students' learning of conceptual
   knowledge. Therefore, the findings in this study have implications that
   teachers should use minimally necessary topic-relevant technical terms
   in biology instruction with the additional use of biological core ideas.
   We suggest further research in pre-service and in-service teacher
   education programmes to evaluate teachers' effective use of technical
   terms in biology lessons essential for fostering conceptual learning.},

Title = {Mobilising a team for the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist: a qualitative
   video study},
Journal = {BMJ QUALITY \& SAFETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {177-188},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background One challenge identified in the Surgical Safety Checklist
   literature is the inconsistent participation of operating teams in the
   safety checks. Less is known about how teams move from preparatory
   activities into a huddle, and how communication underpins this
   gathering. The objective of this study is to examine the ways of
   mobilising teams and the level of participation in the safety checks.
   Methods Team participation in time-out and sign-out was examined from a
   video corpus of 20 elective surgical operations. Teams included
   surgeons, nurses and anaesthetists in a UK teaching hospital, scheduled
   to work in the operations observed. Qualitative video analysis of team
   participation was adapted from the study of social interaction.
   Results The key aspects of team mobilisation were the timing of the
   checklist, the distribution of personnel in the theatre and the
   instigation practices used. These were interlinked in bringing about the
   participation outcomes, the number of people huddling up for time-out
   and sign-out. Timing seemed appropriate when most personnel were present
   in the theatre suite; poor timing was marked by personnel dispersed
   through the theatre. Participation could be managed using the
   instigation practices, which included or excluded participation within
   teams. The factors hindering full-team participation at time-out and
   sign-out were the overlapping (eg, anaesthetic and nursing)
   responsibilities and the use of exclusive instigation practices.
   Conclusions The implementation of the Surgical Safety Checklist
   represents a global concern in patient safety research. Yet how teams
   huddle for the checks has to be acknowledged as an issue in its own
   right. Appropriate mobilisation practices can help bringing fuller teams
   together, which has direct relevance to team training.},

Title = {Student mistakes and teacher reactions in bedside teaching},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 11},
Abstract = {We analyse interactions between teachers and students during
   video-recorded bedside teaching sessions in internal medicine,
   orthopaedics and neurology. Multiple raters used a high-inference
   categorical scheme on 36 sessions. Our research questions concern the
   types of student mistakes, clinical teachers' reactions to them and if
   they use different strategies to address different types of mistakes. We
   used a Poisson model and generalized mixed models to analyse these
   research questions. Most frequently, students made reproduction
   mistakes. Relatively high rates of rejection and a similar prevalence of
   low and high levels of elaboration and correction time for students were
   observed. Reproduction mistakes were associated with the highest level
   of rejection and the lowest level of elaboration. High levels of
   elaboration were observed when students were applying skills in new
   situations. Students were most often allowed time to correct when
   mistakes in the areas of analysis or application of skills and knowledge
   had occurred. There is a decrease in the rate of making mistakes for
   neurology and orthopaedics compared to internal medicine. Reproduction
   mistakes influence significantly the outcome feedback compared to
   application mistakes. Analytic and reproduction mistakes influence
   elaboration significantly compared to application mistakes. We found a
   significant effect whether the lecturer allows time for correction of
   reproduction mistakes compared to application mistakes. These results
   contribute to the understanding of interactive, patient-centred clinical
   teaching as well as student mistakes and how teachers are reacting to
   them. Our descriptive findings provide an empirical basis for clinical
   teachers to react to student mistakes in didactically fruitful ways.},

Title = {Peer versus expert feedback: An investigation of the quality of peer
   feedback among secondary school students},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {133-152},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Few studies have focused on peer assessment at the secondary school
   level. Consequently, we know very little about the quality of the
   feedback secondary school students can produce and its potential
   usefulness. This study was implemented in the context of reciprocal
   online peer assessment of web-portfolios in a secondary school science
   course. We evaluated both quantitative (grades) and qualitative (written
   comments) feedback on student science web-portfolios to assess the
   quality of peer feedback. We further investigated whether either peer or
   expert feedback led peer assesses to revise their work in any way.
   Participants (28 seventh-graders) anonymously assessed each other's
   web-portfolios on designing a CO2-friendly house. Peer assessors and an
   expert assessor used the same pre-specified assessment criteria. Peer
   assessees made revisions as they saw fit after reviewing the feedback.
   The data sources were: the feedback produced, screen capture and video
   data and questionnaires. The quantitative feedback was found to differ
   between peer assessors and the expert and also between peer assessors
   assessing the same web-portfolio, which resulted in low validity and
   reliability. Qualitative written feedback from student and expert
   assessors appeared similar in its structural components. It differed in
   that students placed less emphasis on peer assessees' skills, provided
   fewer suggestions for changes, provided more positive judgments, and
   provided more negative/critical judgments that were not accompanied by
   evidence. Finally, we found that the majority of changes proposed by
   peer assessors were scientifically accurate and assessee groups employed
   decision-making strategies to screen and process peer and expert
   feedback. These findings yield a number of implications for practice and
   policy. The mere explanation of the assessment criteria or prior
   experience with peer assessment procedures is not enough; teachers,
   researchers and policy makers should focus on the type of training and
   scaffolding that peer assessors need in order to produce high quality
   feedback. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The provision of instrumental lessons in certain areas of England can be
   hampered by the geographical position of some schools that are rural in
   nature, with teachers needing to travel long distances between schools.
   Internet-based technologies have been successfully used elsewhere to
   deliver instrumental lessons. A collaboration between the authors, North
   Yorkshire Music Action Zone and YouCanPlay allowed the delivery of
   instrumental lessons using Skype in combination with a Roland VR-3EX, an
   AV Mixer which offers 3 camera angles and good quality sound. Our aim
   was to repurpose existing technology to provide instrumental lessons in
   remote rural communities. The study was conducted in two-phases: a pilot
   study in North Yorkshire; and a further roll-out of the lessons in four
   additional areas (Cornwall; Cumbria; Durham/Darlington; and East Riding
   of Yorkshire). We wished to investigate the technical challenges and
   pedagogical aspects of the delivery, and also compare
   digitally-delivered and face-to-face instrumental lessons to explore the
   differences in behaviour. Data collected included pre- and post-project
   interviews with teachers, recordings of the teachers' first and last
   lessons, and post-project questionnaires from pupils and their parents.
   Results suggested that there were technical challenges relating to
   sound, video and connection quality, and the physical environment of the
   lessons, some of which were alleviated by the Roland VR-3EX. Some
   concerns expressed by teachers in the initial interviews failed to
   materialise; others were overcome to some extent. Pupils concentrated
   well, were motivated to practice, and made good progress. Further
   analysis of the video data has allowed the comparison of face-to-face
   and digitally-delivered lessons. All teachers found the digital teaching
   more challenging than their usual face-to-face teaching; however, all
   reported that they would undertake similar teaching again. This paper
   focuses upon the exploring the behaviour of participants observed in the
   lessons. Digital delivery has the potential to provide greater access to
   instrumental lessons for children in rural communities.},

Title = {Mode-switching in video-mediated interaction: Integrating linguistic
   phenomena into multimodal transcription tasks},
Journal = {LINGUISTICS AND EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {62},
Number = {SI},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Digital environments have shaped unprecedented configurations of
   spontaneous interactions (Herring, 2013), thus giving rise to emergent
   patterns of language variation. The borders between spoken and written
   language have been blurred by the interplay of semiotic resources and
   medium affordances (Kress \& van Leeuwen, 2001), and to the point that
   traditional ideas about spoken/written variation-with related
   implications in language teaching/learning-have been challenged.
   An example of language variation has been labelled mode-switching (which
   paraphrases code-switching, cf. Heller (1988), and draws on Halliday's
   register component of mode, 1978) that describes the alternation of
   speech and writing in the same communicative event in video-mediated
   communication (Sindoni, 2013, 2014a, 2019b). Previous findings show that
   mode-switching is mainly used to manage the flow of conversation and for
   self-repair in multi-party interactions, whereas patterns and use of
   mode-switching are still unmapped in one-to-one interactions.
   Drawing on a corpus of multimodal data (i.e. 48 Skype video-calls
   involving peer interaction between postgraduate students and friends
   and/or relatives), examples of mode-switching will be presented in
   one-to-one interactions by expanding on conversation analysis theories
   (Sacks, Schegloff, \& Jefferson, 1974). Assuming that mode-switching is
   not used to hold the floor in one-to-one contexts, other creative uses
   will be documented, for example with reference to medium affordances,
   speakers' interpersonal attitudes, and interplay with other semiotic
   resources (e.g. layout, visuals, etc.). Discussion of data will include
   excerpts of multimodal transcription of video-mediated interactions
   produced by students to highlight how transcription can be pedagogical
   and helpful in understanding how students heuristically make sense of
   these video-mediated events and establish priorities in their
   reconstructions of video data.
   In conclusion, the productivity of these patterns in spontaneous
   video-mediated communication calls for a systematic theoretical
   reflection and subsequent incorporation in teacher training, syllabus
   design, and institutional learning contexts.

Title = {How is modern bedside teaching structured? A video analysis of learning
   content, social and spatial structures},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background Bedside teaching (BST) is an essential and traditional
   clinical teaching format. It has been subject to various impediments and
   has transformed over time. Besides a decrease in bedside time, there has
   also been a didactic diversification. In order to use time at the
   bedside effectively and understand the current design of BST, we here
   offer an evidence-based insight into how BST is practiced. This may
   serve as a basis for a refinement of its didactic design. Methods In the
   current study, we investigate the interrelationships between learning
   content and the social as well as spatial structures of BST. To this
   end, we have empirically analysed almost 80 hours of video material from
   a total of 36 BST sessions with good interrater reliability. Results BST
   lasted on average 125 min, most of which was spent in plenary and less
   than a third of the time at the patient's bedside. History taking was
   primarily practiced at the bedside while case presentations, clinical
   reasoning and theoretical knowledge were largely taught away from the
   patient. Clinical examination took place to a similar extent in the
   patient's room and in the theory room. Conclusions Even though the
   filmed BSTs are not purely ``bedside{''}, the teaching format
   investigated here is a typical example of undergraduate medical
   education. In order to maximize the teaching time available, a suitable
   learning space should be provided in addition to the bedside. Moreover,
   the clinical examination should be revised in its general sequence prior
   to the BST, and conscious decisions should be made regarding the social
   structure so as to optimize the potential of small groups and plenary
   sessions.},

Abstract = {Background/Context: We lack a nuanced understanding of the potentials
   and needs of multilingual families, particularly those with forced
   displacement histories, in contributing to children's mathematics
   learning. As educators seek to increase refugee students' access to
   powerful mathematics learning, an understanding of how refugee families
   view and participate in their children's mathematics learning can offer
   insights for how we might reach the goal of equitable educational
   access. Purpose/Focus of Study: In the Goc-MAT project, we focused on
   developing equitable mathematics teaching practices with teachers (K-3)
   in schools highly populated with refugee children. The research that we
   present here, drawing on notions of community cultural wealth capital,
   offers a multifaceted view of how families of young children with
   refugee status articulated understandings of their roles in children's
   mathematics learning. Setting: Our fieldwork took place in four
   different cities highly populated by people with refugee status in
   Turkey, the country located at the center of the worldwide trend of mass
   migration. Participants: We examined data from families (N = 54, mainly
   from Syria) who participated in the family engagement component of the
   larger project, carried out through multilingual family mathematics
   workshops. Research Design: We employed qualitative research methods and
   conducted two-year-long observations and video recordings in the context
   of multilingual family mathematics workshops. In the workshops,
   families, teachers, and researchers engaged in patterns and early
   algebra activities, as well as in family conversations facilitated
   through open-ended prompts, mathematics picture books, and educational
   journey maps. Over two years, we collected data comprising recorded
   dialogues with families, artifacts produced in the workshops, and video
   data of families' mathematical interactions. Findings: Our analysis
   yielded two key understandings: (1) Family engagement practices around
   mathematics set a context to realize the nuanced nature of refugee
   families' cultural wealth and efforts for their children's education;
   and (2) refugee families' knowledge of mathematics itself as a
   discipline and their mathematical capital, which are typically not
   recognized in school contexts, can serve as resources for mathematics
   teaching. Conclusions/Recommendations: The findings provide insight for
   teachers, researchers, and policy makers about how we might engage
   multilingual children and families with refugee status in powerful ways
   in mathematics education.},

Volume = {48},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {BackgroundRehabilitation services are scarce in low-income countries,
   where under-representation of some specialist professions has led to the
   role extension of others. An example of this can be found in Kilifi in
   Kenya where the role of speech and language therapy has been taken on by
   occupational therapists and teachers.
   AimsTo investigate the communication practices used by these
   professional groups to support children with complex communication needs
   in a rural part of Kenya and to explore the ways in which this might be
   seen to facilitate or obstruct improved communication by asking the
   following questions: What are the critical features of interactional
   discourse in practitioner-child dyads with caregiver-child dyads
   providing a natural comparison? What communicative modalities and
   practice techniques are invoked? And how does this information relate to
   extending professional roles?
   Methods \& ProceduresAn in-depth, descriptive study of a case series was
   conducted in a school for deaf children and the occupational therapy
   department of a district general hospital. A mixed methodology was used
   involving naturalistic observation and applied linguistics analysis. A
   convenience sample was established comprising six practitioner-child
   dyads assigned to partnership types: (A) three children with hearing
   impairment and their teachers; and (B) three children with cerebral
   palsy and their occupational therapists. As a natural comparator, the
   same three children in B were also observed with their mothers
   (partnership typeC). Dyadic interaction was video recorded on three
   occasions. The video data were sampled, transcribed into standard
   orthography and translated. Codes were applied to determine turn
   structure, linguistic move types and communicative modalities.
   Sequential analysis was conducted on the move types.
   Outcomes \& ResultsPartnership typeA dyads showed a fairly even turn
   distribution between teacher and child. A common pattern was
   teacher-initiated Instruct and Model/Prompt, followed by child response
   in the form of an Action. The most frequently used modality was Sound
   Production and Hands-on-Articulators, which corresponded to articulation
   drill practice. Partnership typeB dyads revealed a tendency towards
   adult domination of turns. The majority of adult-initiated moves
   required no response from the child. The practice technique
   Hands-on-Articulators involved manipulating the oral musculature of the
   child. Partnership typeC dyads showed resonances of typeB dyads,
   although focused more on Motor-Action in relation to task performance.
   Conclusions \& ImplicationsThe assignment of speech and language therapy
   duties to teachers and occupational therapists has resulted in
   suboptimal practice for children with complex communication needs.},

Abstract = {Vygotsky (in: Rieber, Carton (eds) The collected works of L.S. Vygotsky,
   vol 1, Pleneum Press, Newyork, pp 167-241, Retrieved from
   http://images.lib.monash.edu.au/edf5411/04118997.pdf, 1987) stated that
   academic or scientific concepts require a level of conscious awareness
   on the part of the child within everyday situations. Academic concepts
   can be any kind of concept, such as science concepts, mathematics
   concepts, language concepts and so on. Vygotsky theorised how these
   academic concepts could be developed by school aged children, but he
   said less about the prior to school period. Scientific concepts do not
   instantly develop in their final form but rather follow a process of
   conceptual development guided through adult-child interaction. It is
   understood that not any kind of social interactions can be considered
   developmental, but rather it is interaction which is purposeful and
   which is viewed as useful for a child's development. Any kind of
   conceptual development requires the interaction with the ideal form as
   presented through adult interaction in social contexts. In any stage of
   development, ideal forms need to be present in the real context. Ideal
   in the sense that it acts as a model for that which should be achieved
   at the end of the developmental period; and in contrast, the real form
   represents the beginning point of child development (Vygotsky, in: Veer,
   Valsiner (eds) The Vygotsky reader, Blackwell Publishers, Oxford, pp
   338-350, 1994). Many studies have documented the interactions between
   adults and children for developing scientific concepts in formal
   settings but little is understood about what happens in family homes for
   the prior to school age period. We do not know how scientific concepts
   develop during infants-toddlers everyday life at home. What kinds of
   social interactions in everyday family life support infants and toddlers
   to develop early forms of science concepts? This paper presents the
   findings of a study of infant and toddler learning of science at home. A
   total of around 30h of video data were collected from three Bangladeshi
   families in Australia and Singapore. Three children aged from 10 to 36
   months were filmed over 1year in their everyday context. Informed by
   cultural-historical theory, the findings indicate that a form of
   conscious collaboration between parents and infants-toddlers is the key
   for developing small science concepts from rudimentary to final form.
   Small science has been defined as simple scientific narration of the
   everyday moments that infants and toddlers experience at home with their
   families. It was found that it was the families who filled the gap in
   understanding, through actively supporting the development of their
   infant-toddler's higher mental function. Here the relations between
   infant-toddler real forms of development were carefully considered by
   the parents in relation to the ideal form that they created through
   collective dialogue of small science moments in the environment. If
   infants-toddlers learn these small concepts in their everyday settings,
   it is probable that they could link these early forms of understandings
   to learning abstract concepts later in school. This study contributes to
   understanding the nature of social interaction patterns for developing
   small science concepts in the everyday context of family life. This
   paper also provides pedagogical suggestions for early childhood science
   education.},

Abstract = {Background: Coaches developing young talent in team sports must maximise
   practice and learning of essential game skills and accurately and
   continuously assess the performance and potential of each player.
   Relative age effects highlight an erroneous process of initial and
   on-going player assessment, based largely on subjective opinions of game
   performance. A more objective assessment of each player's progress by
   measuring essential skills during practice is warranted to guide and
   improve coaching and assessment of talented children.
   Purpose: To measure the effects of the coaching intervention on
   performance and learning during a group technical practice. A second
   purpose was to repeatedly measure each player's passing, first touch and
   an awareness response and to measure the reliability of peer assessment
   as an immediate source of objective feedback.
   Setting: Weekly coaching sessions at an English professional soccer club
   academy. A total of 22 practices occurred during the second half of a
   soccer season.
   Participants: Academy boys aged 10-12 years, with five players
   participating throughout the study. The coach was a European `A' licence
   holder and an experienced physical education teacher.
   Intervention: The coach and players defined the practice requirements
   and how to perform each skill successfully. Players were taught to
   observe, assess and record the performance of their peers. After the
   practice, players charted their objective scores and bonus game play was
   awarded based on self-set goal attainment.
   Research design: A single-subject, multiple-baseline experiment was used
   to assess the effects of the intervention on performance of the three
   skills and the reliability of the performance measures. The design and
   intervention enabled the repeated measurement of all players'
   performance and learning during each phase and condition of the
   experiment.
   Data collection and analysis: Baseline data were collected from video
   recording of practice and intervention data were collected from
   recording and live by a player and the coach. Percent correct scores for
   each skill were plotted on graphs for visual analysis. Agreements
   between live and primary video data were calculated to evaluate the
   reliability of peer-assessed scores.
   Findings: The intervention was shown to improve the level and
   consistency of performance in all five participants, which, for most
   players and skills, was maintained when the intervention was removed.
   Players were willing and able to reliably assess their peers and collect
   objective data on each player's performance. They enjoyed receiving and
   charting their scores and reported a greater confidence in these skills
   in competitive situations.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest this formal accountability, feedback
   and reinforcement procedure provides a promising method to maximise
   practice and learning and accurately assess the progress of talented
   youth soccer players. Further research is recommended to examine the
   congruent validity of performance measures from more complex learning
   tasks to discriminate talent and tackle relative age effects.
   Implications for future talent development coaching and coach education
   include the potential for repeatable and measurable systems (a
   technology) to track performance and learning during coaching-practice
   to help develop and determine the most able children.},

Title = {An Exploration of the Mechanism of Action of an Equine-Assisted
   Intervention},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Although there is increasing international interest and a
   growing body of evidence discussing the potential impacts of
   equine-assisted interventions to assist those with behavioural, mental
   health, physical health and disability-related issues, there has been
   little exploration of what the mechanism of action may be in causing any
   potential positive impacts. This paper reports on multi-method research
   study which considered in detail what was occurring while participants
   undertook the equine-assisted intervention under study. The intervention
   was implemented with young people with chronic mental health and
   behavioural problems for whom talk-based interventions were not working.
   Previous research has demonstrated long-term health and wellbeing
   benefits in recipients of the intervention. The three datasets were
   video data, psycho-physiological data, in this case, skin conductivity
   response, which is an indicator of emotional arousal, and experiential
   interview data. Our findings indicated that learning natural
   horsemanship skills through this intervention caused participants to
   experience emotional arousal when they asked the horse to perform a
   task. We would suggest that this process of experiencing a positive
   outcome following emotional arousal helps participants to achieve the
   reported behavioural outcomes from this intervention which include
   increased calmness, assertiveness, focus, empathy, communication skills,
   taking responsibility for behaviour, planning and confidence as a
   learner. These changes in behaviour then translate from the intervention
   to the participants' everyday lives, thereby achieving the changes in
   behaviour recorded by those independent practitioners (i.e., social
   workers and teachers) who refer individuals to this intervention.
   Abstract Though long alluded to, there is now an accumulation of
   evidence of the vital contribution that emotion makes to learning.
   Within this broad advance in understanding is a growing body of research
   emphasising the embodied nature of this emotion-based learning. The
   study presented here is a pilot study using a mixed-method approach
   (combining both physiological and experiential methodologies) to give a
   picture of the emotional landscape of people's learning through the
   intervention under study. This has allowed researchers to examine
   mediating pathways that may underlie any effects of an equine-assisted
   intervention. This study specifically focuses on examining the role of
   emotion. The intervention under study was used with young people with
   chronic mental health and behavioural problems for whom talk-based
   interventions were not working. Nine healthy participants aged 18-24
   undertook the equine intervention, with an initial group having
   emotion-related psycho-physiological changes (skin conductance
   responses) measured while viewing their experience on video, and a
   further two participants experiencing a development of the methodology
   as their physiological responses were captured in real time during the
   intervention. The sessions were analysed by a group of five
   cross-disciplinary researchers to determine when significant learning
   episodes occurred, and the findings were that this learning was
   associated with powerful skin conductance responses. The qualitative
   element of the research entailed the participants watching themselves on
   video undertaking the equine intervention. They were asked to stop the
   video and share any changes in emotion at any point while watching. All
   participants experienced a positive temporal change in mood as the
   intervention progressed. All results supported the findings that
   emotional arousal occurred in relation to the participants asking the
   horse to perform a task. This paper will offer two novel contributions:
   (1) description of a new methodology for investigating the mechanism of
   action occurring in this type of intervention and (2) findings from the
   exploration of the intervention via psycho-physiological and
   experiential mechanisms.},
